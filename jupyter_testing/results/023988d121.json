Initially this was done using internal BDUK data and algorithms. Following the completion of the OMR and public consultation processes (described below), the intervention areas were refined. The first stage of this process was undertaken by BDUK. It involves a review of the BDUK internal model of uncommercial premises. This is a model developed and refined within BDUK, which assesses and scores the commercial viability of providing a gigabit capable connection for each premise within the UK. Those premises with the highest score have been assessed as being the least commercially viable premises in the UK. This analysis identified the local bodies4 with the highest number of the non- commercially viable premises in the UK. Further internal algorithms are then used to refine the data. The results of this analysis show the local bodies most in need of intervention in terms of non-commercial premises. This determined the order in which the GIS contracts were to be rolled out, with the areas with the highest proportion of non-commercially viable premises rolled out to first. The findings from the OMR and public consultation process (described below) are used to update and refine this analysis. The findings from the national OMR process provide a complete list of premises that are not expected to receive gigabit capable network coverage in the coming years. These findings are combined with the analysis of the BDUK internal model of uncommercial premises to finalise the set of intervention areas that network providers can bid for BDUK contracts against. There are three types of contracts issued through the GIS intervention: \u25aa Type A contracts: Smaller, hyper local contracts for intervention areas of up to c10,000 premises, which are open tenders that any network provider can bid to deliver; \u25aa Type B contracts: Larger, regional contracts for larger intervention areas of up to 150,000 premises. These contracts have higher financial thresholds network providers have to meet than for Type A contracts, meaning fewer network providers are eligible to bid for contracts; and \u25aa Type C contracts: The largest, cross regional contracts, where there is no viable market interest in Type A or Type B, or where a commitment to a substantially larger scale requirement secures a 4 Local bodies refers to local authorities and Devolved Administrations 8 Ipsos | Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy: Early process evaluation 22-036458-01 | Final version | Public Use | This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements",

By 2022, this has changed with 7,500 properties having gigabit availability, and this being split evenly between commercial and non- commercial premises. However, over 80% of the properties that do not have access to gigabit broadband are in the non-commercial category. 35 | P a g e 3. Effects of Hubs on Broadband The Hub product aims to widen and improve broadband coverage in rural areas, alongside other policies targeting remote areas, such as recent voucher support. This chapter looks at the effects of the Hub on broadband. Its focus is whether nearby broadband effects occur and can be attributed to the Hub. To estimate the impact of the Hubs support, non-recipient areas who are as comparable as possible to the recipient areas \u2013 called the counterfactual \u2013 are explored seeing if the changes seen in the Hub areas differ. Any differences can be attributed to the Hub product in a causal sense, but ensuring the quality of the counterfactual is key. Challenges in identifying a comparison group of areas include untangling the effects of Hubs from other support and wider broadband investments or dealing with the possibility that Hubs have been delivered in all remote public buildings, exhausting the potential comparable areas. Key findings: \u25cf Hubs are positively affecting availability of gigabit. There are 14.3 more premises passed by gigabit capability in the year after the Hub investment in supported areas and this is 7 more than in comparable OAs with schools. Gigabit availability is rising quicker than comparable OAs in the year after support, with around half (51.3%) of the 64% rise in the premises additional in the supported areas. Around a third of the 9.3 rise in premises connected to ultrafast broadband in supported OAs is additional. \u25cf Postcode analysis finds broadband take up and performance improvements due to Hubs. Some part of the 28% improvement in speed of broadband in the postcodes that contain supported schools can be attributed to the Hub investment. The counterfactual postcodes include schools see broadband speed changes, but around 35.7% of the changes seen in Hub schools is not seen in these similar areas. \u25cf At output area level, take up changes are positive but not significantly different to comparable areas. The use of vouchers, the change in broadband speed and the number of fast connections increases in supported areas but not at rates different from the counterfactual areas.",

Where 2 operators have declared partial coverage of premises within a postcode, a complete overlap of coverage is assumed, e.g. if a postcode contains 30 premises and operator A serves 10 premises and operator B serves 15 premises with Superfast Broadband, BDUK considers 15 premises to be NGA white. This assumption aligns with observations from sample testing of suppliers\u2019 online availability checkers and aims to ensure that no premise is omitted from the stated intervention area.

    "How has the UK government's strategy for gigabit-capable broadband evolved from the Superfast Broadband Programme to Project Gigabit, and what lessons have been incorporated into the newer interventions?": {
        "response": "The provided text offers some insights into the evolution of the UK government's broadband strategy, but doesn't offer a comprehensive comparison or explicitly state the lessons learned. Here's what can be gleaned:\n\n* **Superfast Broadband Programme:** Focused on achieving \"superfast\" speeds, not explicitly gigabit capability. The evaluation of this program highlighted the importance of partnerships between local bodies and central government, effective tendering processes, and managing the parameters of the program (clawback, in-contract reporting).  The program also included a \"Hub\" pilot project involving connecting public buildings in hard-to-reach areas as a catalyst for wider rollout.\n\n* **Project Gigabit:**  Shifted focus to gigabit-capable networks, recognizing that a significant portion of premises (around 20% according to the Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review) would not be commercially viable for gigabit rollout without government subsidy.  Project Gigabit builds upon the \"Hub\" concept from the Superfast program, expanding it with the \"Local Full Fibre Networks\" (LFFN) program and the Rural Gigabit Connectivity (RGC) program.  It also incorporates a tiered contracting approach (Type A, B, and C contracts) to cater to different intervention area sizes and market dynamics.  A key element of Project Gigabit is incentivizing commercial investment through barrier-busting measures and focusing public funding on areas where commercial rollout is unlikely.\n\n* **Lessons Incorporated (implicitly):**  While not directly stated, the shift in Project Gigabit toward stimulating commercial investment and prioritizing the hardest-to-reach areas suggests a recognition that purely public-funded rollout is not sufficient.  The tiered contracting approach also indicates a move towards more tailored interventions based on local market conditions.  The continued focus on connecting public buildings (Hubs) demonstrates the perceived value of this approach as a catalyst for wider coverage.  The text also mentions challenges with the Hub approach regarding supplier engagement and potential disincentives for further connections due to access charges, suggesting these are areas of ongoing refinement.\n\nIn short, the evolution appears to be towards a more nuanced approach that leverages private investment where possible, prioritizes public funding for the most challenging areas, and uses a more flexible contracting model.  However, the provided text doesn't explicitly detail the specific lessons learned and how they have shaped Project Gigabit. More information would be needed to provide a more complete answer.",

Key findings are: \u25cf The Hub product invested in connecting public buildings to gigabit capable broadband in areas which will not support commercial roll-out without some kind of subsidy. Between May 2019 and the end of March 2022, 1,021 connections have been made across rural UK. The evidence finds that the selection process did identify such buildings. \u25cf Identification of Hubs was through partnerships between BDUK and a sponsor, such as central government departments and agencies, and local government. This enabled looking across a portfolio of hard-to-connect schools, General Practice (GP) surgeries, libraries and other public buildings and select those needing a connection. The logic of the Hub product is then for the connections to enable the public building to use digital technologies in delivering services, but then also gigabit capable networks closer to businesses and residences in remote areas. \u25cf A final aim is to encourage a more competitive supplier market. Interviews highlight that there are some challenges in this regard, with the selection process using government partners potentially not introducing suppliers early enough to integrate the connections into their wider offer to the area near the Hubs. Some suppliers also noted that the focus on Openreach provisioning the connection meant their onward use to connect businesses and residences would incur Openreach access charges, potentially lessening the incentives for further connections. Delivering broadband connections in rural areas In 2018, the Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review (FTIR) estimated that around 80% of premises in the UK would be commercially viable to support two or more gigabit-capable networks. Around 10% are likely to be \u2018grey areas\u2019, meaning that, whilst they are commercially viable for one operator, there may be a role for Government intervention to ensure investment in these areas to resolve strategic uncertainties, with the final 10% of premises in areas which will not support commercial roll-out without some kind of subsidy. Investing in connecting public buildings is viewed to support this aim, and the RGC programme has provided a pilot to test driving gigabit rollout in the final 20% using investments connecting public sector buildings (Hubs). 21 | P a g e The Hub Product The Hub product was first piloted in the 2017 Local Full Fibre Network programme, where it was Public Sector Building Upgrades. The RGC Programme, beginning in May 2019 and running until the end of March 2021, continued this type of intervention with delivery of the builds to be completed by the end of March 2022. The Hub approach involves identifying demand for gigabit connectivity to meet an area\u2019s",

An econometric analysis was undertaken using a fixed effects analytical framework. The analysis compared gigabit-capable and ultrafast availability in the project areas and matched comparator areas. For more details of the analytical approach please see the technical annex for the LFFN wave one evaluations. The impacts are presented in the table below, which suggests that the projects the West Sussex PSAT project and Tameside may have contributed to a slower roll out of gigabit- capable networks in the areas surrounding the project build, but contributed to a faster roll out along the Trans Pennine Initiative route. The analysis also identified significant positive impacts on ultrafast coverage in Tameside and around LFFN schools, with significant negative impacts in the areas surrounding the West Sussex PSAT project and along the Trans Pennine Initiative route. The explanation for these results could be that the subsidised coverage has discouraged other network providers from building in the adjacent area as much as they would have done in the absence of the project, or that roll out is",

Progress has been substantial: \u25cf A number of telecoms infrastructure providers have secured funding and accelerated plans to increase their footprint over the next few years. INCA, the trade body for independent network providers, quotes that \u00a35.6 billion is now committed through independent1 telecoms providers, with a target of up to 30 million gigabit connections being available from independent telecoms providers by the end of 2025. CityFibre alone aims to deliver 8-10 million homes and businesses. \u25cf Openreach has increased its target gigabit coverage from 20 million UK premises to 25 million by the end of 2026, including 3 million premises in predominantly rural areas. Openreach announced in late May 2021 that it will be increasing its deployment rate from 43,000 homes and businesses every week to 75,000 a week. \u25cf Following approval of its Joint Venture with O2, Virgin Media reiterated its previous commitment to covering 7-10 million premises with a potential investment in digital infrastructure of around \u00a310 billion in total. \u25cf Some of these newly-announced commercial",

Initially this was done using internal BDUK data and algorithms. Following the completion of the OMR and public consultation processes (described below), the intervention areas were refined. The first stage of this process was undertaken by BDUK. It involves a review of the BDUK internal model of uncommercial premises. This is a model developed and refined within BDUK, which assesses and scores the commercial viability of providing a gigabit capable connection for each premise within the UK. Those premises with the highest score have been assessed as being the least commercially viable premises in the UK. This analysis identified the local bodies4 with the highest number of the non- commercially viable premises in the UK. Further internal algorithms are then used to refine the data. The results of this analysis show the local bodies most in need of intervention in terms of non-commercial premises. This determined the order in which the GIS contracts were to be rolled out, with the areas with the highest proportion of non-commercially viable premises rolled out to first. The findings from the OMR and public consultation process (described below) are used to update and refine this analysis. The findings from the national OMR process provide a complete list of premises that are not expected to receive gigabit capable network coverage in the coming years. These findings are combined with the analysis of the BDUK internal model of uncommercial premises to finalise the set of intervention areas that network providers can bid for BDUK contracts against. There are three types of contracts issued through the GIS intervention: \u25aa Type A contracts: Smaller, hyper local contracts for intervention areas of up to c10,000 premises, which are open tenders that any network provider can bid to deliver; \u25aa Type B contracts: Larger, regional contracts for larger intervention areas of up to 150,000 premises. These contracts have higher financial thresholds network providers have to meet than for Type A contracts, meaning fewer network providers are eligible to bid for contracts; and \u25aa Type C contracts: The largest, cross regional contracts, where there is no viable market interest in Type A or Type B, or where a commitment to a substantially larger scale requirement secures a 4 Local bodies refers to local authorities and Devolved Administrations 8 Ipsos | Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy: Early process evaluation 22-036458-01 | Final version | Public Use | This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements",

However, other stakeholders and network providers noted that the design was a compromise which was acceptable to the market and encouraged participation, as the original design risked network providers declining to participate in the intervention. Those stakeholders which raised concerns also noted that the approach used was an improvement, in terms of preventing overbuild, compared to the Superfast Broadband Programme, due to the OMR approach used (described below). 19 Ipsos | Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy: Early process evaluation 22-036458-01 | Final version | Public Use | This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for Market Research , ISO 2025 | \u00a9 Ipsos 2023 Learning from the experiences of the Superfast Broadband Programme was a key aspect of the GIS intervention's initial design. The GIS intervention was seen as an evolution of the Superfast Broadband Programme, incorporating lessons learned to enhance the effectiveness of the new intervention. The aim was to not just enhance connectivity, but also to create an environment that encourages private investment and competition in broadband infrastructure.. The GIS intervention\u2019s design allowed contracts of different sizes (local, regional and cross-regional), which would allow network providers of different sizes to participate. This built on lessons from the Superfast Broadband Programme where initially there was a framework contract, through which the majority of contracts were awarded (11 contracts were awarded through open market procurement). This reflected the nature of the market at the time the Superfast Broadband Programme was launched, when few network providers existed in the UK market. However, in later rounds of the Superfast Broadband Programme contracts were offered which alt-net providers could bid for. With the design of the GIS intervention increasing the number of network providers that could bid for contracts, it was hoped that competition would increase the quality of the bids and offer better value for money for the Government. However, some larger suppliers and local authority stakeholders were concerned about the changes made to contract types in comparison to the Superfast Broadband Programme. The design of three types of intervention area (local, regional and cross regional) meant that there were some contracts within the GIS intervention which would be more suitable for smaller network providers to bid for. Whilst there was an understanding that there were smaller, newer suppliers involved in the GIS intervention, to include these providers increased the risk to BDUK, in terms of the quality of networks, wholesale",

Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 59 190. As far as the Government is concerned, there is no magic number of mobile network operators. Each merger control case should be assessed on its merits at a particular time, by the relevant authorities. The European Commission, supported by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority, rejected a proposed merger of O2 and Three in 2016 because of pricing concerns resulting from a reduction in retail competition; concerns about the impact that a merger of MNOs in different network sharing arrangements would have on innovation and network roll out; and unease that there would be a reduction in wholesale competition with fewer potential hosts for MVNOs.88 191. There can be a tension between incentivising investment (with positive consumer benefits in the longer-term) and protecting consumers from the risk of higher retail prices in the short-term. Some argue that the increased cost efficiencies and increased scale from consolidation would enable greater investment and better consumer outcomes.89 At the same time, other analysis suggests there is no significant difference in industry-level investment between four and three player markets.90 Mobile investment should be closely monitored by Ofcom and appropriate options considered if it were to become clear that the current market structure was not supporting network investment in 5G at sustainable levels.",

        "response": "The information and relationships you've provided still don't allow for a direct comparison of the impact of regional vs. local supplier models on broadband speed and effectiveness in rural areas. The core issue remains: the contract types (A, B, C) are linked to the *size* of the area, not the *type* of supplier.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n* **Contract Types and Area Size:** You've clarified that Contract Types A, B, and C relate to local, regional, and cross-regional sizes. This reinforces that the procurement model is structured around project scale, not specifically supplier type.\n\n* **GIS Intervention Goals:** The relationships confirm that the GIS intervention aims to increase competition and value for money.  However, there's no information on whether these goals were achieved *differently* based on the type of supplier involved.\n\n* **Superfast Program and Larger Suppliers:** The connection between the Superfast Broadband Programme and its reliance on larger suppliers is reiterated.  This provides context but doesn't illuminate how regional vs. local suppliers perform within the *GIS* framework.\n\n* **Stakeholder Concerns and Smaller Suppliers:** The relationship between stakeholder concerns, risks, and smaller suppliers is also restated. This highlights potential risks but doesn't offer data on actual performance differences between smaller (potentially local) and larger (potentially regional) suppliers.\n\n**Missing Links:**  To answer the question, we would need information linking *supplier type* to *outcomes*.  For example:\n\n* Did local suppliers primarily win Type A contracts, and regional suppliers Types B and C?\n* What were the average deployment speeds and effectiveness rates for projects delivered by local vs. regional suppliers, specifically in rural areas?\n\nWithout this data, we can only speculate.  It's *possible* that local suppliers might be more effective in smaller, localized rural projects (Type A), while regional suppliers might be better suited for larger, more complex rural deployments (Types B and C).  However, this is just a hypothesis based on general logic, not on evidence from the provided text or relationships.",

Conclusions This chapter looks at the Hubs product, focusing on the Rural Gigabit Connectivity delivery that occurred from 2019-22. It highlights: \u25cf Hub investments until 2022. Delivered through the RGC Programme from May 2019 with completed builds up to March 2022, these have provided 1,021 connections in eligible public buildings, primarily schools and GP surgeries. \u25cf Selecting eligible buildings has focused on areas distant from the gigabit capable network. Public buildings were identified through ten projects led by partner bodies such as local authorities, DfE, devolved administrations, that have prioritised public buildings poorly served by broadband. This worked well by integrating wider plans of suppliers, managers of public buildings, and Openreach. \u25cf The connection is generally provided by Openreach. It is responsible for 791 of the 1,021 Hub connections. There are then some community-based or regional suppliers (such as Fibrus Networks in Northern Ireland). 34 | P a g e \u25cf Suppliers were attracted by the Hub product. It delivered fibre connectivity to rural and deep rural areas and provided a platform for further connections. But they felt that marketing of the Hub investments could be improved by contacting suppliers earlier. Also, the detail of the level of potential funding, timings for applications etc were unclear. \u25cf Delivery is linked to the wider provision of online services in a Hub. This can be managed through an aggregator (common for GP surgeries). Some Hubs experienced delays in delivery and noted information about progress was sometimes limited. \u25cf The logic model envisages spatial effects beyond the supported areas. The anticipated direct benefits are to the public services delivered in the Hubs enabling more digital technology in schools, surgeries etc. But then these connections bring the gigabit- capable network closer to hard-to-reach areas. Suppliers are more likely to be able to meet local residential and business demand for fast broadband. \u25cf Areas supported have low broadband performance and coverage. In 2020, 11.9% of premises in the supported areas have gigabit available, less than half the 27.7% seen in the UK. Download speeds are 42,6 Mbps compared to 72.5 in the wider UK. \u25cf Provision of gigabit capable connections is unlikely on a commercial basis. There are about 19,000 properties in the 997 postcodes where at least one Hub connection has been provided,",

Such infrastructure models could be supported by promoting access to 5G spectrum, through spectrum trading or potentially new spectrum sharing models. At the service level, enhanced mobile broadband services would be provided by MNOs and MVNOs, alongside new services enabled by existing and new players. 3.4.1 How we assessed these models 188. We have considered the potential models against a range of criteria \u2013 including the extent of 5G coverage, the pace of roll out, the costs, the incentives to improve quality and innovation over time, and how feasible it would be to implement the models.87 189. The Government recognises there is a debate about the optimal level of competitive intensity and consolidation in the UK mobile sector, and notes the number of recent mobile merger control cases across Europe, with a range of outcomes. The Government is clear that network competition between MNOs has been an important driver of mobile investment and expects that this will continue to be the case for 5G. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 59 190. As far as the Government is concerned, there is no magic number of mobile network operators. Each merger control case should be assessed on its merits at a particular time, by the relevant authorities. The European Commission, supported by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority, rejected a proposed merger of O2 and Three in 2016 because of pricing concerns resulting from a reduction in retail competition; concerns about the impact that a merger of MNOs in different network sharing arrangements would have on innovation and network roll out; and unease that there would be a reduction in wholesale competition with fewer potential hosts for MVNOs.88 191. There can be a tension between incentivising investment (with positive consumer benefits in the longer-term) and protecting consumers from the risk of higher retail prices in the short-term. Some argue that the increased cost efficiencies and increased scale from consolidation would enable greater investment and better consumer outcomes.89 At the same time, other analysis suggests there is no significant difference in industry-level investment between four and three player markets.90 Mobile investment should be closely monitored by Ofcom and appropriate options considered if it were to become clear that the current market structure was not supporting network investment in 5G at sustainable levels.",

Investment decisions will likely vary across areas, reflecting the differing cost of rolling out networks \u2013 depending on the type of property, property density, difficulty of accessing roads and sites, and the proximity to existing passive infrastructure \u2013 in different areas. They may also be driven by expectations of the overall level of demand and willingness to pay. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 40 108. This means that while some areas are likely to be commercially attractive for multiple networks to roll out, other areas may only be able to sustain one commercial fibre network, or none at all. Our analysis suggests that there will be three broad zones for fibre roll out: \u2022 Areas that can support commercial roll out of two or more gigabit-capable networks. These would typically include cities, towns and some rural areas where the costs of deployment and demand conditions mean that it is commercially viable to invest. These areas are likely to comprise around 80% of premises. \u2022 Areas that can support commercial roll out of single fibre networks. These would typically include smaller market towns and some rural areas where the costs of deployment and demand conditions would mean that it is commercially viable for one player to invest (c.10% of premises). \u2022 Areas that are unable to support commercial roll out. There will be some parts of the country (c.10% of premises) which would not be commercially viable, and would require additional funding. These could comprise higher deployment cost remote or rural areas, with low population density and challenging geographies. See section 2.7. 109. Our analysis suggests that a large majority of the country will be able to support two or more competing gigabit-capable networks. In the early years, these areas may see only a single network; however, over time, these areas would see the presence of multiple networks. 110. The degree of any regulation should be proportionate to the characteristics of the market and competitive conditions \u2013 one would only expect to see regulatory interventions where competition concerns clearly arise. For areas where there is actual or prospective effective competition between networks, we would not anticipate the need for regulation as competitive pressures will shape investment and pricing decisions. For other areas, we would expect the regulatory model to evolve over time as networks are established. If market power emerges, regulated wholesale access (including price controls) may be needed to address competition concerns. However, this may not be necessary in the",

The ECC reforms came into force in December 2017. Independent economic analysis projected that these reforms could reduce the cost of accessing sites by around 40% over time.92 The Government\u2019s view is that the reforms provide an effective regulatory framework to support infrastructure deployment. However, we recognise that there is a risk that these changes might lead to some market uncertainty and consequent negotiating difficulties during the transitional period. We are working closely with stakeholders across the sector to address these risks. The Government will consider undertaking a formal review of the ECC reforms to assess their impact in 2019. 3.5.2 Planning reforms 196. The Government recognises the need to keep planning regulation under review and to listen to suggestions from industry for how new technology is best supported in the planning regime. Therefore the Government will continue to work with the sector to promote understanding and take-up of the wide range of planning reforms brought forward and reflect on them to understand where the current planning regime could further support the deployment of digital infrastructure. If the telecoms industry can demonstrate that there are further reforms that could support deployment which warrant changes to planning, and make a clear case for change, we will work swiftly to consider the proposals and consult more widely on appropriate reforms. Our ambition, subject to the Parliamentary timetable, is to deliver any reforms as rapidly as possible. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 61 3.5.3 Access to public sites 197. The Government, as a major landlord in the UK, will open up its own estate to support the deployment of mobile infrastructure wherever possible. We have developed a Digital Infrastructure Toolkit to aid this process and are publishing it alongside this Review. This toolkit addresses feedback from industry about barriers to deployment on government buildings, and seeks to streamline the agreement process between departments and industry. The Government will keep the toolkit under review and publish updates on the number of sites that are hosting mobile infrastructure. 198. In the longer-term, the toolkit has the potential to inform best practice for the wider public sector \u2013 from town halls to museums. The Government encourages other public sector landlords to make their own assets more readily available for network deployment. 3.5.4 Transmission and power 199.

We have measured a consequential significant change in overall Fibre-To-The-Premise coverage in the first year since completion (2018/19). \u25cf The Trans Pennine Initiative (TPI) funded the placement of gigabit-capable fibre infrastructure along the existing rail route between Manchester and York, in partnership with Network Rail Telecoms. They have used this project to develop a commercial blueprint for use across the UK rail network, enabling suppliers to access trackside fibre to deliver connectivity in some of the remotest locations in the UK. Data within the report highlights that there has been an increase in network providers offering Fibre-To-The-Premise (FTTP) services along the TPI route. 13 This project was an early pathfinder for the GigaHub model, which brings together local public sector customers to create enough broadband demand to reduce the financial risk of building new full fibre networks.

We are in the process of implementing a rolling Open Market Review process, establishing a maintained national view of commercial build plans for the following three years. This will give a more comprehensive up-to-date view of commercial delivery and will avoid the need for having dedicated local Open Market Reviews. This is followed by a Public Review to validate the findings of the Open Market Review and BDUK\u2019s mapping to ensure it correctly represents the information provided by suppliers and to ensure that the right areas are targeted by Project Gigabit subsidy. BDUK invites stakeholders (including the public, businesses, internet service providers and broadband infrastructure operators) to provide us with feedback about the proposed eligible areas for government investment set out in each Public Review document.

Key findings are: \u25cf The Hub product invested in connecting public buildings to gigabit capable broadband in areas which will not support commercial roll-out without some kind of subsidy. Between May 2019 and the end of March 2022, 1,021 connections have been made across rural UK. The evidence finds that the selection process did identify such buildings. \u25cf Identification of Hubs was through partnerships between BDUK and a sponsor, such as central government departments and agencies, and local government. This enabled looking across a portfolio of hard-to-connect schools, General Practice (GP) surgeries, libraries and other public buildings and select those needing a connection. The logic of the Hub product is then for the connections to enable the public building to use digital technologies in delivering services, but then also gigabit capable networks closer to businesses and residences in remote areas. \u25cf A final aim is to encourage a more competitive supplier market. Interviews highlight that there are some challenges in this regard, with the selection process using government partners potentially not introducing suppliers early enough to integrate the connections into their wider offer to the area near the Hubs. Some suppliers also noted that the focus on Openreach provisioning the connection meant their onward use to connect businesses and residences would incur Openreach access charges, potentially lessening the incentives for further connections. Delivering broadband connections in rural areas In 2018, the Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review (FTIR) estimated that around 80% of premises in the UK would be commercially viable to support two or more gigabit-capable networks. Around 10% are likely to be \u2018grey areas\u2019, meaning that, whilst they are commercially viable for one operator, there may be a role for Government intervention to ensure investment in these areas to resolve strategic uncertainties, with the final 10% of premises in areas which will not support commercial roll-out without some kind of subsidy. Investing in connecting public buildings is viewed to support this aim, and the RGC programme has provided a pilot to test driving gigabit rollout in the final 20% using investments connecting public sector buildings (Hubs). 21 | P a g e The Hub Product The Hub product was first piloted in the 2017 Local Full Fibre Network programme, where it was Public Sector Building Upgrades. The RGC Programme, beginning in May 2019 and running until the end of March 2021, continued this type of intervention with delivery of the builds to be completed by the end of March 2022. The Hub approach involves identifying demand for gigabit connectivity to meet an area\u2019s",
