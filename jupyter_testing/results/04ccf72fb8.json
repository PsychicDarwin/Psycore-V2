The average cost per premises contracted to be upgraded by Phase is presented in the figure below. This shows that the average cost per premises upgraded has increased by Phase. This is not surprising as the projects maximised the number of premises upgraded, therefore easier / cheaper premises were upgraded first. Additionally, in Phase 3, there was more of a focus on the more expensive FTTP connections (rather than FTTC), which may also contribute to the increase in unit cost. Figure 2.2: Cost per premise upgraded and funding source7 Source: Cora Management Information, June 2020 There are significant differences between the cost per contracted premises by provider and Phase (see the table below). In Phase 1, the cost per premises for BT / OpenReach was relatively low (\u00a3366), but the unit cost to BT / OpenReach increased through the Phases to \u00a31,703 in Phase 3. Similarly, the cost per premises delivered was high for Gigaclear in Phases 2 and 3 (approximately \u00a31,555 to \u00a31,749). The costs to Airband are also relatively high. However, the unit costs to UK Broadband (Relish) and Callflow are low in comparison, at \u00a3253 and \u00a3460 per premises upgraded. 7 Gainshare was an agreement between the programme beneficiary (network provider) and Local Bodies to access the expected clawback monies before the end of the take-up clawback period, with the monies to be used to fund further network upgrades. \u00a3367 \u00a3815 \u00a31,977 \u00a30 \u00a3500 \u00a31,000 \u00a31,500 \u00a32,000 Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 BDUK Local Body ERDF / Defra Supplier Capex Supplier Opex Clawback / gainshare Underspend Ipsos MORI | 18-101398-01 Evaluation of the Superfast Broadband Programme \u2013 Process evaluation report 19 18-101398-01 | FINAL VERSION | | Internal Use Only | This work was carried out in accordance",

It was reported that the alternative approaches to tendering were more resource intensive than the recommended approach. Therefore, it is recommended that Local Bodies follow the approach recommended by BDUK, and that lotting of contracts is utilised where possible, to improve cost effectiveness. Building strong relationships with providers was seen as important to ensuring a good number of responses to tenders issued. 7.1.4 Project delivery and management \u25aa Most Local Bodies had utilised similar project management approaches, with day to day project managers overseen by steering groups / committees and where required support was provided by BDUK. This was described as an appropriate model to manage the contracts by the Local Bodies. A small number of projects described working with the Programme beneficiary as being partnership rather than a client-contractor relationship. These bodies felt they got more out of the provider on the delivery of the project with barriers addressed through close partnership working. This again reinforces that Local Bodies should work hard to develop and maintain relationships with providers. \u25aa The delivery of Phase 3 contracts has been delayed, with roll out behind where providers anticipated it would be. Some of the reasons for this were highlighted as being the capacity of Programme beneficiaries to deliver their contracts, the duration of time required to resolve change requests and the enforcement of milestone zero within contracts. BDUK has been working to develop new approaches to ensure change requests are resolved in a timely manner and this should help to resolve this issue, but Local Bodies also need to ensure that their processes allow for a rapid response to change requests and escalate significant change requests to BDUK expediently. 7.2 Programme outcomes 7.2.1 Market outcomes The key findings from the market analysis undertaken are: \u25aa Phase 3 contracts increased the number of premises passed by Next Generation Access (NGA) services by 2,300 to 16,600 on postcodes benefitting from subsidised coverage by the end of September 2019 (with the weight of evidence to the lower end of this range). The share of the 79,100 premises upgraded by the end of September 2019 that would not have otherwise benefitted from NGA coverage is estimated at between 3 and 21 percent.

The share of the 79,100 premises upgraded by the end of September 2019 that would not have otherwise benefitted from Next Generation Access (NGA) coverage is estimated at between 3 and 21 percent. \u25aa Phase 3 contracts increased the number of premises with superfast availability by 10,800 to 29,300, and the number of premises with Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) coverage by 19,000 to 30,300. The additionality of superfast and FTTP coverage was higher than for NGA coverage at between 14 and 55 percent of premises receiving subsidised coverage. This indicates that some premises benefitting from subsidised upgrades would have otherwise received from NGA coverage that did not deliver superfast speeds. \u25aa The results suggest that the processes used to identify the commercial plans of providers were not fully effective in establishing those premises that would not benefit from commercial deployments in the near term. Several explanations for this emerged from the research, including that their investment cycles were determined over relatively short time horizons (12 to 24 months) which did not match the OMR cycle. \u25aa Most Local Bodies and Superfast Broadband Programme beneficiaries took part in activities to promote the take-up of superfast broadband connections, and as this activity was undertaken in most areas (mainly for Phase 1 and Phase 2 contracts) it is difficult to measure the impact of the activities, although interviewees suggested they felt it was important in raising awareness of superfast connections and encouraging take-up, although there was no quantitative evidence to support this.3 \u25aa Based on projections provided by network providers at the tendering stage, the proposed network build under Phase 3 contracts was expected either to generate losses or to deliver positive rates of return that were substantially lower than the cost of capital faced by the network provider. This indicates that public subsidies would have been needed to create a sufficient economic incentive to deliver these investments. \u25aa While the contracts have proven largely effective in containing subsidies to the minimum needed for the project to go forward, the public sector has incurred opportunity costs by tying 3 BDUK has carried out internal analysis of the factors driving take-up, and a light-touch evaluation of the Superfast Take-up grant in a separate piece of research",

There are very few studies that have sought to examine the cost-effectiveness of broadband Programmes in the EU after delivery had been completed. This may in part be because of a relative lack of public Programmes on the same scale as the Superfast Programme and a consequent lack of published evaluative work. However, there are some examples where the expected unit cost of premises passed has been estimated. It should be noted that these are projected public sector costs per gross premises passed, rather than observed costs. The estimated costs are: 27, 28 \u25aa In Austria, the cost per premises",

In the two stage feedback process, network providers are first provided with information about all the aspects of their bid, which bits of it comply with the requirements set out by BDUK in the guidance documents, and where they do not why the submission does not comply.

    "How has the UK government's strategy for gigabit-capable broadband evolved from the Superfast Broadband Programme to Project Gigabit, and what lessons have been incorporated into the newer interventions?": {
        "response": "The provided text details some key shifts in the UK government's broadband strategy from the Superfast Broadband Programme to Project Gigabit:\n\n* **Focus:** Superfast aimed to provide superfast broadband (defined in the text as 30Mbps) coverage, while Project Gigabit focuses on gigabit-capable connections.  This reflects the increasing demand for higher bandwidth.\n* **Scale of Intervention:** Project Gigabit acknowledges that a significant portion (around 80%) of premises are commercially viable for gigabit deployment by private companies. Therefore, it concentrates on the remaining 20%, particularly the hardest-to-reach premises, in contrast to Superfast's broader approach.\n* **Procurement:** While Superfast initially relied heavily on a National Procurement Framework (with BT/Openreach being the dominant supplier), Project Gigabit introduces a more diversified approach.  This includes a Dynamic Purchasing System for Local Suppliers and Regional Supplier procurements, aiming for a more competitive supplier market.  This addresses the potential limitations of relying on a single provider.\n* **Lessons Learned - Public Sector Hubs:** The \"Hub\" model, piloted in earlier programs and continued in Project Gigabit, leverages investment in connecting public buildings in hard-to-reach areas.  The intent is to not only benefit those buildings but also to stimulate further commercial deployments in the surrounding areas.  The document highlights challenges with this approach, such as the need for earlier supplier engagement and potential disincentives from access charges imposed by infrastructure owners like Openreach. These lessons are being considered in Project Gigabit's implementation.\n* **Regional and Local Focus:**  Project Gigabit uses more targeted Regional and Local Supplier procurements, acknowledging that different areas have different needs and challenges. This contrasts with the broader approach of Superfast.\n\nIn short, Project Gigabit builds upon the Superfast Broadband Programme by focusing on gigabit speeds, targeting intervention in areas where commercial deployment is unlikely, diversifying the supplier base, and incorporating lessons learned about public sector anchor projects (Hubs) to stimulate private investment. The shift towards regional and local procurements also suggests an increased focus on tailoring interventions to specific areas.",

Key findings are: \u25cf The Hub product invested in connecting public buildings to gigabit capable broadband in areas which will not support commercial roll-out without some kind of subsidy. Between May 2019 and the end of March 2022, 1,021 connections have been made across rural UK. The evidence finds that the selection process did identify such buildings. \u25cf Identification of Hubs was through partnerships between BDUK and a sponsor, such as central government departments and agencies, and local government. This enabled looking across a portfolio of hard-to-connect schools, General Practice (GP) surgeries, libraries and other public buildings and select those needing a connection. The logic of the Hub product is then for the connections to enable the public building to use digital technologies in delivering services, but then also gigabit capable networks closer to businesses and residences in remote areas. \u25cf A final aim is to encourage a more competitive supplier market. Interviews highlight that there are some challenges in this regard, with the selection process using government partners potentially not introducing suppliers early enough to integrate the connections into their wider offer to the area near the Hubs. Some suppliers also noted that the focus on Openreach provisioning the connection meant their onward use to connect businesses and residences would incur Openreach access charges, potentially lessening the incentives for further connections. Delivering broadband connections in rural areas In 2018, the Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review (FTIR) estimated that around 80% of premises in the UK would be commercially viable to support two or more gigabit-capable networks. Around 10% are likely to be \u2018grey areas\u2019, meaning that, whilst they are commercially viable for one operator, there may be a role for Government intervention to ensure investment in these areas to resolve strategic uncertainties, with the final 10% of premises in areas which will not support commercial roll-out without some kind of subsidy. Investing in connecting public buildings is viewed to support this aim, and the RGC programme has provided a pilot to test driving gigabit rollout in the final 20% using investments connecting public sector buildings (Hubs). 21 | P a g e The Hub Product The Hub product was first piloted in the 2017 Local Full Fibre Network programme, where it was Public Sector Building Upgrades. The RGC Programme, beginning in May 2019 and running until the end of March 2021, continued this type of intervention with delivery of the builds to be completed by the end of March 2022.

Rolling out small cells in dense urban areas, which is where MNOs are likely to be most significantly capacity constrained, also appears feasible on a mid-2020s timetable. However, rolling out a more extensive 5G network that meets the needs of all potential use cases, may take considerably longer. 185. Given the greater number of cell sites likely required for 5G over the longer-term, the traditional model of cell deployment is likely to be too expensive and impractical to adopt. Operators will need to work together with local stakeholders to improve processes to enable more efficient small cell deployment. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 58 3.4 What is the best future market model for 5G? 186. The Government\u2019s strategic priority is to promote efficient investment and innovation in 5G, and ensure that 5G deployment can occur at sufficient pace as new use cases and demand materialises. 187. There are a range of alternative market models that could emerge in the UK, with different approaches to service provision, network infrastructure and spectrum authorisation. We have considered three broad potential models and how they might promote 5G investment, innovation and availability: \u2022 Current Model. In this model, there would continue to be multiple vertically integrated national operators, sharing infrastructure through commercial arrangements and supplementing this with the use of independent infrastructure providers. Competition at the retail level would be largely driven by the MNOs, with a degree of wholesale access provision to resellers, including MVNOs. Spectrum authorisation would continue to be on the basis of long-term national licences. \u2022 Single National Wholesale Network. Under this model, a monopoly infrastructure provider would offer a wholesale service to MNOs and other wireless operators, with the aim of reducing costs and improving coverage. Spectrum might be pooled and allocated to the monopoly provider. An example of this model is the \u2018Red Compartida\u2019 or \u2018shared network\u2019 in Mexico. This is a wholesale-only network created as a result of government policy to expand mobile coverage, competition and create an environment for 5G services. \u2022 Market Expansion Model. This relies on competition between multiple national networks but also enables new infrastructure and spectrum access models. In this model, the UK would continue to benefit from network competition between multiple national operators. National networks would be supplemented by \u2018neutral host\u2019 infrastructure and private networks to, for example, deliver small cell deployments in",

Conclusions This chapter looks at the Hubs product, focusing on the Rural Gigabit Connectivity delivery that occurred from 2019-22. It highlights: \u25cf Hub investments until 2022. Delivered through the RGC Programme from May 2019 with completed builds up to March 2022, these have provided 1,021 connections in eligible public buildings, primarily schools and GP surgeries. \u25cf Selecting eligible buildings has focused on areas distant from the gigabit capable network. Public buildings were identified through ten projects led by partner bodies such as local authorities, DfE, devolved administrations, that have prioritised public buildings poorly served by broadband. This worked well by integrating wider plans of suppliers, managers of public buildings, and Openreach. \u25cf The connection is generally provided by Openreach. It is responsible for 791 of the 1,021 Hub connections. There are then some community-based or regional suppliers (such as Fibrus Networks in Northern Ireland). 34 | P a g e \u25cf Suppliers were attracted by the Hub product.

Initially this was done using internal BDUK data and algorithms. Following the completion of the OMR and public consultation processes (described below), the intervention areas were refined. The first stage of this process was undertaken by BDUK. It involves a review of the BDUK internal model of uncommercial premises. This is a model developed and refined within BDUK, which assesses and scores the commercial viability of providing a gigabit capable connection for each premise within the UK. Those premises with the highest score have been assessed as being the least commercially viable premises in the UK. This analysis identified the local bodies4 with the highest number of the non- commercially viable premises in the UK. Further internal algorithms are then used to refine the data. The results of this analysis show the local bodies most in need of intervention in terms of non-commercial premises. This determined the order in which the GIS contracts were to be rolled out, with the areas with the highest proportion of non-commercially viable premises rolled out to first. The findings from the OMR and public consultation process (described below) are used to update and refine this analysis. The findings from the national OMR process provide a complete list of premises that are not expected to receive gigabit capable network coverage in the coming years. These findings are combined with the analysis of the BDUK internal model of uncommercial premises to finalise the set of intervention areas that network providers can bid for BDUK contracts against. There are three types of contracts issued through the GIS intervention: \u25aa Type A contracts: Smaller, hyper local contracts for intervention areas of up to c10,000 premises, which are open tenders that any network provider can bid to deliver; \u25aa Type B contracts: Larger, regional contracts for larger intervention areas of up to 150,000 premises. These contracts have higher financial thresholds network providers have to meet than for Type A contracts, meaning fewer network providers are eligible to bid for contracts; and \u25aa Type C contracts: The largest, cross regional contracts, where there is no viable market interest in Type A or Type B, or where a commitment to a substantially larger scale requirement secures a 4 Local bodies refers to local authorities and Devolved Administrations 8 Ipsos | Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy: Early process evaluation 22-036458-01 | Final version | Public Use | This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements",

This program had issues with delays in Phase 3.\n\n* **Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy (GIS):**  Employs three contract types:\n    * **Type A:** Smaller, hyper-local contracts (up to ~10,000 premises) using open tenders.\n    * **Type B:** Larger, regional contracts (up to ~150,000 premises) with higher financial thresholds, limiting the number of eligible bidders.\n    * **Type C:** Largest, cross-regional contracts used when there's no viable market interest in Types A or B, or when large-scale commitments are beneficial.\n\n* **Project Gigabit:** Introduces a more localized approach with:\n    * **Local Supplier contracts:** Geographically focused (1,000-8,000 premises) using a Dynamic Purchasing System.  These are intended to complement regional procurements, target areas scheduled for later regional deployments, or address smaller \"infill\" areas.\n    * **Regional Supplier procurements:**  The text doesn't provide much detail on these, other than mentioning they exist.\n\n* **Hubs Model (Rural Gigabit Connectivity):** Focused on connecting public sector buildings (Hubs) in hard-to-reach areas as a catalyst for broader commercial deployment.  While generally successful, there were challenges with supplier engagement timing and clarity about funding.\n\nWhile the text highlights the *intent* of using different models (e.g., local suppliers for faster deployment in smaller areas, regional suppliers for larger areas), it *doesn't* offer data or analysis comparing their actual speed and effectiveness.

Public buildings were identified through ten projects led by partner bodies such as local authorities, DfE, devolved administrations, that have prioritised public buildings poorly served by broadband. This worked well by integrating wider plans of suppliers, managers of public buildings, and Openreach. \u25cf The connection is generally provided by Openreach. It is responsible for 791 of the 1,021 Hub connections.

Such infrastructure models could be supported by promoting access to 5G spectrum, through spectrum trading or potentially new spectrum sharing models. At the service level, enhanced mobile broadband services would be provided by MNOs and MVNOs, alongside new services enabled by existing and new players. 3.4.1 How we assessed these models 188. We have considered the potential models against a range of criteria \u2013 including the extent of 5G coverage, the pace of roll out, the costs, the incentives to improve quality and innovation over time, and how feasible it would be to implement the models.87 189. The Government recognises there is a debate about the optimal level of competitive intensity and consolidation in the UK mobile sector, and notes the number of recent mobile merger control cases across Europe, with a range of outcomes. The Government is clear that network competition between MNOs has been an important driver of mobile investment and expects that this will continue to be the case for 5G. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 59 190. As far as the Government is concerned, there is no magic number of mobile network operators. Each merger control case should be assessed on its merits at a particular time, by the relevant authorities. The European Commission, supported by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority, rejected a proposed merger of O2 and Three in 2016 because of pricing concerns resulting from a reduction in retail competition; concerns about the impact that a merger of MNOs in different network sharing arrangements would have on innovation and network roll out; and unease that there would be a reduction in wholesale competition with fewer potential hosts for MVNOs.88 191. There can be a tension between incentivising investment (with positive consumer benefits in the longer-term) and protecting consumers from the risk of higher retail prices in the short-term. Some argue that the increased cost efficiencies and increased scale from consolidation would enable greater investment and better consumer outcomes.89 At the same time, other analysis suggests there is no significant difference in industry-level investment between four and three player markets.90 Mobile investment should be closely monitored by Ofcom and appropriate options considered if it were to become clear that the current market structure was not supporting network investment in 5G at sustainable levels.",

This in turn had enabled children to learn remotely, video consultations to take place and council services to continue running without the need for face to face contact at a time when such contact had the potential to spread the virus. For some school stakeholders however, the Programme was only part of the solution and for some disadvantaged children access to IT equipment was the prohibitive factor in enabling remote learning. A similar issue was raised for GP services with those digitally illiterate or remote at more risk in the pandemic, either needing to visit in person or not visit at all.

This drew primarily on the Connected Nations dataset published by Ofcom which provides postcode level data on superfast and ultrafast availability, FTTP coverage, connections and data usage. Further data was drawn from ThinkBroadband and the published FTTP roll-out plans of Openreach and other telecommunications suppliers to provide local and regional context for the project. Finally, a variety of additional Office for National Statistics data on the evolution of the local economy was drawn on to provide further evidence on local trends on employment growth and unemployment. \u25aa Semi-structured qualitative interviews with project stakeholders: Consultations with stakeholders in the projects were undertaken in between September 2022 and April 2023 to gather views on how the projects had delivered against their intended objectives, the wider impacts achieved, barriers encountered and lessons learned. Stakeholders consulted included project leads and local stakeholders either involved in the delivery of the projects or who benefitted from them. Interviews covered emerging demand for fibre services and connections and impacts of the LFFN project on organisations and the local area. The",

        "response": "Sharing passive infrastructure, such as ducts and poles, plays a vital role in the UK's nationwide full fibre plan.  It's a key enabler of efficient and cost-effective deployment, especially in challenging areas or for smaller providers.\n\nHere's how it relates to the broader goals:\n\n* **Enables Cost-Effective and Efficient Rollout:** Sharing drastically reduces the expense and time involved in deploying fibre, especially compared to constructing new infrastructure.\n\n* **Supports 5G Rollout:**  Fibre networks are fundamental for 5G, and sharing passive infrastructure makes it easier to build the dense fibre needed for 5G cell sites.\n\n* **Encourages Network Convergence:** Shared infrastructure can support both fixed and mobile services, promoting convergence, a stated government objective.\n\n* **Addresses Efficient Investment:** Sharing avoids wasteful duplication of infrastructure, promoting efficient investment.\n\n* **Requires Unrestricted Access:**  Effective sharing hinges on unrestricted access to existing infrastructure, especially Openreach's, a key regulatory focus.\n\n**Alignment with Regulatory Goals:**\n\nPassive infrastructure sharing directly supports key regulatory goals:\n\n* **Promoting Competition:**  Sharing reduces barriers to entry for smaller providers who can't afford to build their own infrastructure, fostering a more competitive market.\n\n* **Faster Rollout:** Streamlined processes and reduced costs associated with sharing accelerate the overall pace of full fibre rollout.\n\n* **Efficient Investment:** Sharing maximizes the return on investment by preventing redundant infrastructure.\n\n* **Supporting 5G Deployment:**  Sharing enables faster and more efficient fibre deployment, which is essential for 5G rollout.\n\nIn conclusion, sharing passive infrastructure is vital for achieving the UK's full fibre ambitions. It aligns perfectly with regulatory goals for a competitive market, efficient investment, and rapid, cost-effective deployment of fibre and 5G.",

One of the key challenges in building fibre networks that support multiple services (i.e. fixed and 5G) will be to forecast accurately where 5G cell sites will be needed in future. This will be necessary to identify extra fibres and break-out points that can be incorporated into physical networks today, thereby reducing the need for subsequent civil engineering when 5G networks are rolled out. It is important that the networks required for full fibre services are built in ways that can support 5G cells. 236. The Government would like network operators and mobile operators, working with local authorities and other relevant parties, to engage on the likely locations for 5G cell sites, for the purpose of ensuring that fibre networks can be future-proofed.109 237. The Government will support this by ensuring that existing programmes, in particular 5G Trials and Testbeds and LFFN, promote investments that recognise convergence, and use the new Local Connectivity Group to share information from these programmes more widely. 4.2.2 Recognising convergence and considering access network requirements holistically, through unified market reviews 238. Ofcom currently conducts separate market reviews for business connectivity and wholesale local access market (covering homes and small businesses). As wholesale access networks move from copper to fibre, networks are increasingly able to support a range of uses. For example, FTTP networks built for residential broadband can also be used for mobile backhaul. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 71 239. This distinction between markets may lead to inefficient investment decisions. For example, the DPA remedy only applies to the WLA market and can be used only for fibre deployments which are primarily intended for residential or small business use110, but not for fibre networks that serve dedicated mobile backhaul links or core network links for fixed networks. Fibre providers who want to exploit synergies and provide multiple services, including for mobile network backhaul, may therefore be excluded from using DPA, increasing their costs, and increasing the costs of 5G roll out. 240. Ofcom should consider moving to single, unified market reviews. Combined with the availability of longer review periods (outlined in section 2), this would signal a long-term commitment to support infrastructure investment. 4.2.3 Unrestricted access to ducts and poles for all purposes 241.

The changes seen in the supported areas are generally positive in gross terms: there are a greater number of fast broadband connections, download speeds increase and the uptake of voucher connections increases. However, the pace of changes seen is no different to comparable areas, with only three estimates for the additional number of fast connections providing evidence of additional effects. Effects on broadband uptake in postcodes with supported schools Table 3.4 focuses on the postcodes of the supported schools and the counterfactuals. A challenge for the direct effect of the Hub investment on an area is that it is likely to be modest as only one premise is supported in improving their connection. Analysis at the output area level covers many 44 | P a g e premises. In other support measures, such as broadband vouchers, the number of properties that are connected to gigabit capable connections is generally high at OA level. However, only one or sometimes two Hubs are connected in an OA, so the gross direct changes in the Hub areas can be lost in the OA-level area analysis. In the modelling focusing on schools, the postcode for the Hub and that of the school in each of the counterfactual OA can be extracted and then linked to the postcode level data in Connected Nations.

Key findings are: \u25cf The Hub product invested in connecting public buildings to gigabit capable broadband in areas which will not support commercial roll-out without some kind of subsidy. Between May 2019 and the end of March 2022, 1,021 connections have been made across rural UK. The evidence finds that the selection process did identify such buildings. \u25cf Identification of Hubs was through partnerships between BDUK and a sponsor, such as central government departments and agencies, and local government. This enabled looking across a portfolio of hard-to-connect schools, General Practice (GP) surgeries, libraries and other public buildings and select those needing a connection. The logic of the Hub product is then for the connections to enable the public building to use digital technologies in delivering services, but then also gigabit capable networks closer to businesses and residences in remote areas. \u25cf A final aim is to encourage a more competitive supplier market. Interviews highlight that there are some challenges in this regard, with the selection process using government partners potentially not introducing suppliers early enough to integrate the connections into their wider offer to the area near the Hubs. Some suppliers also noted that the focus on Openreach provisioning the connection meant their onward use to connect businesses and residences would incur Openreach access charges, potentially lessening the incentives for further connections. Delivering broadband connections in rural areas In 2018, the Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review (FTIR) estimated that around 80% of premises in the UK would be commercially viable to support two or more gigabit-capable networks. Around 10% are likely to be \u2018grey areas\u2019, meaning that, whilst they are commercially viable for one operator, there may be a role for Government intervention to ensure investment in these areas to resolve strategic uncertainties, with the final 10% of premises in areas which will not support commercial roll-out without some kind of subsidy. Investing in connecting public buildings is viewed to support this aim, and the RGC programme has provided a pilot to test driving gigabit rollout in the final 20% using investments connecting public sector buildings (Hubs). 21 | P a g e The Hub Product The Hub product was first piloted in the 2017 Local Full Fibre Network programme, where it was Public Sector Building Upgrades. The RGC Programme, beginning in May 2019 and running until the end of March 2021, continued this type of intervention with delivery of the builds to be completed by the end of March 2022. The Hub approach involves identifying demand for gigabit connectivity to meet an area\u2019s",

Switchover should be led by industry, working closely with Ofcom and Government. The Government will set up a mechanism with Ofcom and industry for planning the switchover process. Switchover should meet a number of policy conditions: \u2022 Plans support a timely switchover; \u2022 Efficient, so that switchover is smooth with minimal consumer disruption; \u2022 Transparent, so that customers have the information they need to make informed choices and clearly signalled via notice periods so operators have certainty; \u2022 Consistent, with existing regulatory and consumer obligations; \u2022 Pro-competitive, so processes are in place to support easy switching between networks; and \u2022 A fair deal for consumers and adequate safeguards for vulnerable customers. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 48 144. It is realistic to assume that switchover could be underway in the majority of the country by 2030, but the timing will ultimately be dependent on the pace of fibre roll out and subsequent take- up of fibre products.63 We would only expect switchover to start when a significant proportion of the population has taken-up new fibre services. 145. The process would build on the work of industry and Ofcom preparing for the switch-off the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), which is coming to the end of its life. PSTN will be retired by industry by the mid-2020s and be replaced by Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology, which uses a broadband connection to make calls. Industry must ensure a smooth switchover process 146. Industry must be responsible for putting in place robust processes and systems required to support a quick, smooth and hassle-free migration of a large of number of customers from copper to fibre. They will need the capacity to handle a larger than usual number of people switching service and network providers. 147. To aid the migration of customers to fibre networks, we expect that network operators will offer suitable \u2018entry level\u2019 products at prices close to those offered on copper networks.64 This would have the further benefit of protecting the interests of customers who do not want to pay for higher broadband speeds. Internet Service Providers will benefit from operational cost savings from the move to fibre (e.g. fewer faults) and we expect these to be passed on to consumers, reducing any cost increase to end users from switching. However, we note that the incentive to",
