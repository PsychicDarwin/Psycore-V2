        "response": "The UK government's strategy for gigabit-capable broadband has evolved from the Superfast Broadband Programme to Project Gigabit, reflecting a shift in context and recognizing lessons learned.\n\nThe Superfast Broadband Programme aimed to deliver nationwide coverage, but the context has changed.  The original program faced market failures, with insufficient capable infrastructure in place, and a market dominated by technologies unable to provide the future needs of UK businesses and households.  This necessitated government intervention to invest in fiber infrastructure.\n\nProject Gigabit builds on this, aiming for nationwide coverage.  Key differences and lessons learned include:\n\n* **Focus on complete coverage:** Project Gigabit aims to connect the entire UK, unlike the potentially uneven coverage of the earlier program.\n\n* **Collaboration with devolved administrations:**  A more coordinated approach with devolved administrations (Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) is now in place, aligning with existing Superfast contracts in those nations, ensuring a more holistic rollout.\n\n* **Targeted subsidy:**  The new program aims to minimize negative effects on competition and crowding out of private investment, unlike potentially less targeted prior interventions. Subsidy is designed to address market failures and ensure complete coverage without unduly impacting the private sector's investment incentives.\n\n* **Procurement adherence to regulations:**  Project Gigabit continues to use the Public Contracts Regulations (2020) to manage subsidy control requirements, which is a more formalized approach to ensure accountability.\n\n* **Addressing deployment barriers:**  The new program recognizes the need to reduce costs and speed up rollout by addressing current barriers to telecoms infrastructure development.  This is a key lesson from the past, recognizing that the previous implementation faced challenges in cost and speed of implementation.\n\n* **Data collection and forecasting:** Project Gigabit is gathering data from telecoms providers to form a complete picture of future gigabit infrastructure coverage, ensuring a more informed and potentially more efficient deployment strategy.",

This made it difficult to accurately reflect the current market conditions.\n\n* **Mixed supplier and local authority engagement:**  There were inconsistent levels of engagement from suppliers and local authorities in the OMR process. Some reviewed frequently, while others did not participate at all. This inconsistency in participation could have skewed the results.\n\n* **Potential for overbuilding, improved but still a concern:** The evaluation acknowledged that the OMR approach was an improvement over the Superfast Broadband Programme in terms of preventing overbuilding.  However, the risk of overbuilding still existed, though to a lesser extent, and was a concern raised by some stakeholders.\n\n* **Challenge of maintaining accuracy of data throughout the process:** The dynamic nature of the market made it difficult to ensure the data collected during the review process remained accurate and relevant throughout the entire intervention.",

        "response": "Passive infrastructure sharing, specifically reusing existing ducts and poles, is crucial to the UK's full fibre deployment plan because it significantly reduces the cost and time required to roll out new networks.  The document states that civil works (installing ducts and poles) account for about 70% of fibre network deployment costs.  By reusing existing infrastructure, the time and money needed for these crucial upfront steps are significantly reduced.  This is particularly important for remote rural areas, where the high costs of new infrastructure often make commercial deployment economically unviable.\n\nThis strategy relates to regulatory goals in that it aims to encourage large-scale deployment of new networks across both rural and urban areas.  The document notes the need for changes in the regulatory and policy environment to incentivize this investment.  By making infrastructure deployment more efficient and cost-effective through passive infrastructure reuse, the UK hopes to create a more favorable environment for investment in areas that would otherwise be too expensive for commercial operators to serve alone. This is crucial because the cost of deployment in those areas is often higher due to factors like low population densities and topography, making them less attractive for private investment, hence the need for regulatory incentives.",
