    "How did BDUK classify premises as White, Grey, Black, or Under Review in the Norfolk Public Review, and what implications did these classifications have for eligibility for government subsidy?": {
        "response": "In the context of the BDUK's classification system, premises are categorized as White, Grey, Black, or Under Review based on the availability and planned provision of broadband services:\n\n1. **White Areas**: These are areas where no broadband infrastructure currently exists or is planned in the near future. Premises in White areas are typically eligible for government subsidy because they lack existing or planned broadband services.\n\n2. **Grey Areas**: These areas have broadband infrastructure from one provider, or there are plans for such infrastructure. Grey areas may have limited eligibility for government subsidy, as there is already some level of service available or planned.\n\n3. **Black Areas**: These areas have broadband infrastructure from at least two providers, or there are plans for such infrastructure. Premises in Black areas are generally not eligible for government subsidy, as they are considered to have sufficient market competition and service availability.\n\n4. **Under Review**: This classification is used for areas where the status of broadband provision is uncertain or where further investigation is needed to determine the appropriate classification. The eligibility for subsidy in these areas would depend on the outcome of the review.\n\nThe implications of these classifications are significant for determining eligibility for government subsidies. White areas are prioritized for subsidy to encourage broadband infrastructure development where it is lacking, while Black areas are typically excluded from subsidy to avoid distorting market competition where sufficient services are already available. Grey areas may receive limited support, depending on specific circumstances and policy objectives.",

                "text": ". There are about 19,000 properties in the 997 postcodes where at least one Hub connection has been provided, and in 2019 none had gigabit availability. By 2022, this has changed with 7,500 properties having gigabit availability, and this being split evenly between commercial and non- commercial premises. However, over 80% of the properties that do not have access to gigabit broadband are in the non-commercial category. 35 | P a g e 3. Effects of Hubs on Broadband The Hub product aims to widen and improve broadband coverage in rural areas, alongside other policies targeting remote areas, such as recent voucher support. This chapter looks at the effects of the Hub on broadband. Its focus is whether nearby broadband effects occur and can be attributed to the Hub. To estimate the impact of the Hubs support, non-recipient areas who are as comparable as possible to the recipient areas \u2013 called the counterfactual \u2013 are explored seeing if the changes seen in the Hub areas differ. Any differences can be attributed to the Hub product in a causal sense, but ensuring the quality of the counterfactual is key. Challenges in identifying a comparison group of areas include untangling the effects of Hubs from other support and wider broadband investments or dealing with the possibility that Hubs have been delivered in all remote public buildings, exhausting the potential comparable areas. Key findings: \u25cf Hubs are positively affecting availability of gigabit. There are 14.3 more premises passed by gigabit capability in the year after the Hub investment in supported areas and this is 7 more than in comparable OAs with schools. Gigabit availability is rising quicker than comparable OAs in the year after support, with around half (51.3%) of the 64% rise in the premises additional in the supported areas. Around a third of the 9.3 rise in premises connected to ultrafast broadband in supported OAs is additional. \u25cf Postcode analysis finds broadband take up and performance improvements due to Hubs. Some part of the 28% improvement in speed of broadband in the postcodes that contain supported schools can be attributed to the Hub investment. The counterfactual postcodes include schools see broadband speed changes, but around 35.7% of the changes seen in Hub schools is not seen in these similar areas. \u25cf At output area level, take up changes are positive but not significantly different to comparable areas. The use of vouchers, the change in broadband speed and the number of fast connections increases in supported areas but not at rates different from the counterfactual areas.",

The TCA places an obligation on both the UK and EU to have an effective system of subsidy control with independent oversight. BDUK will ensure that it meets these subsidy principles in awarding public subsidy for gigabit- capable broadband infrastructure, for example, by ensuring subsidy is designed to target failure in the market to achieve full UK coverage while minimising negative effects on competition. Public subsidy will be targeted to limit the risks of crowding out private investment, altering commercial investment incentives and ultimately distorting competition. Projects will continue to be procured under the Public Contracts Regulations (2020), to help meet our subsidy control requirements. Suppliers have the opportunity during the OMR and Public Review stages, to share with BDUK any firm and credible investment plans that may mean that public subsidy will not be warranted. Requesting a review of a subsidy award Under UK subsidy control requirements, anyone can request for a review about the award of subsidy. Requests must be submitted no later than one month from the date of the award of the subsidy for Norfolk. The award of subsidy will follow the procurement and contract award and BDUK\u2019s National Competency Centre will consider requests submitted within the one- month timescale, under the terms of the TCA. This proposed award will be published by the Department of Business Energy Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The process for making such a request will be published here too.

        "response": "The UK government's strategy for broadband has evolved significantly from the Superfast Broadband Programme to Project Gigabit, reflecting changes in technology, market conditions, and policy priorities. Here are the key aspects of this evolution and the lessons incorporated into the newer interventions:\n\n1. **Focus on Gigabit-Capable Broadband**: \n   - The Superfast Broadband Programme primarily aimed to provide superfast speeds (at least 30 Mbps) to as many premises as possible. In contrast, Project Gigabit focuses on delivering gigabit-capable broadband, which offers much higher speeds and future-proofs the network infrastructure.\n\n2. **Targeting Hard-to-Reach Areas**:\n   - Both programs have aimed to extend broadband coverage to underserved areas, but Project Gigabit places a stronger emphasis on reaching the hardest-to-reach premises that cannot currently achieve superfast speeds. This includes specific contracts in devolved nations and targeted pockets within England.\n\n3. **Procurement Models**:\n   - The Superfast Broadband Programme used a National Procurement Framework, primarily involving large suppliers like BT. Project Gigabit, however, employs more flexible procurement models, including Local Supplier contracts for smaller, geographically focused projects. This approach allows for more tailored solutions and encourages participation from a broader range of suppliers.\n\n4. **Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS)**:\n   - Project Gigabit utilizes a Dynamic Purchasing System to facilitate competition and select suppliers for local contracts. This system is designed to be more adaptive and responsive to market conditions compared to the previous framework.\n\n5. **Incorporation of Lessons Learned**:\n   - The evaluation of the Superfast Broadband Programme highlighted the importance of effective partnerships between local bodies and central government, efficient tendering processes, and the need for robust project management. These lessons have been incorporated into Project Gigabit to improve delivery efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n6. **Subsidy Control and Market Engagement**:\n   - Project Gigabit aligns with the UK's subsidy control regime, ensuring that public subsidies are targeted to address market failures without distorting competition. The program includes Open Market Reviews and Public Reviews to validate investment plans and ensure subsidies are appropriately targeted.\n\n7. **Increased Investment and Ambition**:\n   - Project Gigabit represents a significant increase in investment and ambition, with a goal to achieve nationwide gigabit-capable coverage. This reflects a broader government objective to enhance digital infrastructure and support economic growth.\n\nOverall, Project Gigabit builds on the foundation laid by the Superfast Broadband Programme but with a more ambitious scope, refined procurement strategies, and a focus on future-proofing the UK's digital infrastructure.",

The TCA places an obligation on both the UK and EU to have an effective system of subsidy control with independent oversight. BDUK will ensure that it meets these subsidy principles in awarding public subsidy for gigabit- capable broadband infrastructure, for example, by ensuring subsidy is designed to target failure in the market to achieve full UK coverage while minimising negative effects on competition. Public subsidy will be targeted to limit the risks of crowding out private investment, altering commercial investment incentives and ultimately distorting competition. Projects will continue to be procured under the Public Contracts Regulations (2020), to help meet our subsidy control requirements. Suppliers have the opportunity during the OMR and Public Review stages, to share with BDUK any firm and credible investment plans that may mean that public subsidy will not be warranted. Requesting a review of a subsidy award Under UK subsidy control requirements, anyone can request for a review about the award of subsidy. Requests must be submitted no later than one month from the date of the award of the subsidy for Norfolk. The award of subsidy will follow the procurement and contract award and BDUK\u2019s National Competency Centre will consider requests submitted within the one- month timescale, under the terms of the TCA. This proposed award will be published by the Department of Business Energy Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The process for making such a request will be published here too.

We have measured a consequential significant change in overall Fibre-To-The-Premise coverage in the first year since completion (2018/19). \u25cf The Trans Pennine Initiative (TPI) funded the placement of gigabit-capable fibre infrastructure along the existing rail route between Manchester and York, in partnership with Network Rail Telecoms. They have used this project to develop a commercial blueprint for use across the UK rail network, enabling suppliers to access trackside fibre to deliver connectivity in some of the remotest locations in the UK. Data within the report highlights that there has been an increase in network providers offering Fibre-To-The-Premise (FTTP) services along the TPI route. 13 This project was an early pathfinder for the GigaHub model, which brings together local public sector customers to create enough broadband demand to reduce the financial risk of building new full fibre networks. The solution is often a public sector network of sites that provide spine and backhaul fibre to a location. OFFICIAL 02/08/2021 Project Gigabit Delivery Plan Summer Update 26 Useful Information Market Reviews In each identified geography or \u2018Lot\u2019, BDUK conducts an Open Market Review to understand from suppliers if there is any current or planned investment over the next three years in broadband infrastructure (Next Generation Access broadband, ultrafast and gigabit-capable). We are in the process of implementing a rolling Open Market Review process, establishing a maintained national view of commercial build plans for the following three years. This will give a more comprehensive up-to-date view of commercial delivery and will avoid the need for having dedicated local Open Market Reviews. This is followed by a Public Review to validate the findings of the Open Market Review and BDUK\u2019s mapping to ensure it correctly represents the information provided by suppliers and to ensure that the right areas are targeted by Project Gigabit subsidy. BDUK invites stakeholders (including the public, businesses, internet service providers and broadband infrastructure operators) to provide us with feedback about the proposed eligible areas for government investment set out in each Public Review document. A list of public reviews can be found at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk- gigabit-programme-public-reviews. Key Eligibility Requirements for Subsidy The outcome of the Open Market Review and Public Review is shown in terms of \u2018White\u2019, \u2018Black\u2019",

    "What were the key limitations encountered during the OMR and public review processes as identified in the early process evaluation of the Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy intervention?": {
        "response": "The early process evaluation of the Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy intervention identified several key limitations encountered during the Open Market Review (OMR) and Public Review processes. These limitations are categorized as challenges and include:\n\n1. **Data Accuracy and Completeness**: Both the OMR and Public Review processes faced challenges related to ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data provided by suppliers. Inaccurate or incomplete data could lead to incorrect mapping of broadband coverage, affecting the identification of areas eligible for subsidy.\n\n2. **Supplier Engagement**: Engaging with a wide range of suppliers to gather comprehensive data was a challenge for both processes. Some suppliers may have been reluctant to share detailed investment plans, which could hinder the effectiveness of the review process.\n\n3. **Dynamic Market Conditions**: The rapidly changing nature of the broadband market posed a challenge for both the OMR and Public Review processes. New investments and technological advancements could quickly alter the landscape, making it difficult to maintain an up-to-date view of coverage and investment plans.\n\n4. **Complexity of Mapping**: Accurately mapping broadband coverage and planned investments required sophisticated tools and methodologies. The complexity of this task could lead to delays and potential inaccuracies in identifying eligible areas.\n\n5. **Stakeholder Feedback**: Gathering and incorporating feedback from a diverse range of stakeholders, including the public, businesses, and local authorities, was a complex process for both the OMR and Public Review. Ensuring that all relevant perspectives were considered and addressed was a significant undertaking.\n\n6. **Coordination with Local Bodies**: Effective coordination with local bodies was essential to validate the findings of the OMR and Public Review. However, differences in local priorities and resources could complicate this coordination.\n\nThese challenges highlight the complexities involved in conducting comprehensive and accurate reviews in a dynamic and complex market environment, which are crucial for ensuring that subsidies are effectively targeted to areas most in need of gigabit-capable broadband infrastructure.",

This in turn had enabled children to learn remotely, video consultations to take place and council services to continue running without the need for face to face contact at a time when such contact had the potential to spread the virus. For some school stakeholders however, the Programme was only part of the solution and for some disadvantaged children access to IT equipment was the prohibitive factor in enabling remote learning.

Such infrastructure models could be supported by promoting access to 5G spectrum, through spectrum trading or potentially new spectrum sharing models. At the service level, enhanced mobile broadband services would be provided by MNOs and MVNOs, alongside new services enabled by existing and new players. 3.4.1 How we assessed these models 188. We have considered the potential models against a range of criteria \u2013 including the extent of 5G coverage, the pace of roll out, the costs, the incentives to improve quality and innovation over time, and how feasible it would be to implement the models.87 189. The Government recognises there is a debate about the optimal level of competitive intensity and consolidation in the UK mobile sector, and notes the number of recent mobile merger control cases across Europe, with a range of outcomes. The Government is clear that network competition between MNOs has been an important driver of mobile investment and expects that this will continue to be the case for 5G. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 59 190. As far as the Government is concerned, there is no magic number of mobile network operators. Each merger control case should be assessed on its merits at a particular time, by the relevant authorities. The European Commission, supported by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority, rejected a proposed merger of O2 and Three in 2016 because of pricing concerns resulting from a reduction in retail competition; concerns about the impact that a merger of MNOs in different network sharing arrangements would have on innovation and network roll out; and unease that there would be a reduction in wholesale competition with fewer potential hosts for MVNOs.88 191. There can be a tension between incentivising investment (with positive consumer benefits in the longer-term) and protecting consumers from the risk of higher retail prices in the short-term. Some argue that the increased cost efficiencies and increased scale from consolidation would enable greater investment and better consumer outcomes.89 At the same time, other analysis suggests there is no significant difference in industry-level investment between four and three player markets.90 Mobile investment should be closely monitored by Ofcom and appropriate options considered if it were to become clear that the current market structure was not supporting network investment in 5G at sustainable levels.",

We will, however, continue to honour any vouchers already issued at that stage for providers to claim completed, eligible, gigabit connections. We have been working with suppliers to help judge projects that would meet the new eligibility criteria, and transition those projects that were submitted within a recent deadline. The majority of premises will retain their eligibility under the new voucher conditions, but to help individuals check, we will be launching a new eligibility checker. Where eligible, consumers will be able to contact registered suppliers to understand how vouchers could be used as part of a project to connect their community. Where not eligible, we will explain why and provide information so that consumers can identify what connectivity options are available to them and timelines for when we would reappraise eligibility if network build plans have changed or not progressed as expected. Providers will also be able to alert where they believe our eligibility assessment may be based on inaccurate records, just as they can today. It is also important that telecoms providers monitor when and where procurements are planned. We will pause the issue of new vouchers while we survey the market through the Public Review process and initiate procurements for target intervention areas. This is so bidders have a stable baseline through the process. Once a contract has been awarded, we will understand which premises are covered in immediate implementation plans and which will be part of a later phase. In the latter case, we are likely to make these areas eligible for 19/03/2021 Project Gigabit - Phase One Delivery Plan 22 OFFICIAL vouchers again for communities and providers that are seeking a connection sooner than otherwise planned. Public Sector Hubs The procurement of connectivity services in the public sector can help to drive the availability of gigabit infrastructure and services into the hardest to reach parts of the UK. We have successfully helped procure a number of Public Sector Hubs in remote areas. We have set up a Dynamic Purchasing System (RM6095) with Crown Commercial Services for Gigabit-Capable Connectivity and now have 41 suppliers fully registered. Local authorities and devolved administrations are procuring services from the DPS, working with the supplier market to reduce barriers for the commercial sector to deliver gigabit services to the hardest to reach areas. We expect many other government departments and authorities to participate in regional procurements, with 100-200+ hubs sites expected in each regional procurement.",

    "How have different procurement models (e.g., regional vs. local suppliers) impacted the speed and effectiveness of broadband infrastructure delivery in rural areas?": {
        "response": "The impact of different procurement models, such as regional versus local suppliers, on the speed and effectiveness of broadband infrastructure delivery in rural areas can be understood through various concepts and characteristics associated with each model:\n\n1. **Local Supplier Contracts**:\n   - **Flexibility and Focus**: Local supplier contracts are characterized by their ability to provide tailored solutions that address specific local needs and conditions. This flexibility allows for more effective deployment in areas with unique challenges, such as difficult terrain or dispersed populations.\n   - **Speed of Deployment**: By concentrating resources and efforts on smaller geographic areas, local suppliers can often deploy infrastructure more quickly than larger regional projects. This focused approach reduces the complexity and time required for planning and execution.\n   - **Engagement with Local Communities**: Local suppliers often have better relationships with local communities and authorities, facilitating smoother project implementation and greater community support. This engagement can lead to more successful and accepted projects.\n\n2. **Regional Supplier Contracts**:\n   - **Economies of Scale**: Regional contracts benefit from economies of scale, potentially reducing costs per premise connected. This can be advantageous in terms of budget efficiency and the ability to cover larger areas.\n   - **Consistency and Standardization**: Regional suppliers can provide a more standardized approach to infrastructure deployment, ensuring consistent service levels across a wider area. This can be beneficial for maintaining quality and reliability.\n   - **Complexity and Coordination**: However, regional projects can be more complex to manage due to the larger geographic scope and the need to coordinate across multiple localities. This complexity can sometimes slow down deployment compared to more focused local projects.\n\n3. **Impact on Rural Areas**:\n   - **Targeting Hard-to-Reach Areas**: Local supplier contracts may be more effective in targeting the hardest-to-reach premises due to their focused approach, addressing specific local challenges and needs.\n   - **Infill Opportunities**: Local supplier contracts can complement regional projects by addressing gaps or \"infill\" areas that larger projects might overlook, ensuring more comprehensive coverage.\n\nOverall, the choice between regional and local procurement models depends on the specific goals and conditions of the broadband deployment project. A combination of both approaches can be used to balance the benefits of scale with the need for targeted, efficient delivery in challenging rural environments.",

Such infrastructure models could be supported by promoting access to 5G spectrum, through spectrum trading or potentially new spectrum sharing models. At the service level, enhanced mobile broadband services would be provided by MNOs and MVNOs, alongside new services enabled by existing and new players. 3.4.1 How we assessed these models 188. We have considered the potential models against a range of criteria \u2013 including the extent of 5G coverage, the pace of roll out, the costs, the incentives to improve quality and innovation over time, and how feasible it would be to implement the models.87 189. The Government recognises there is a debate about the optimal level of competitive intensity and consolidation in the UK mobile sector, and notes the number of recent mobile merger control cases across Europe, with a range of outcomes. The Government is clear that network competition between MNOs has been an important driver of mobile investment and expects that this will continue to be the case for 5G. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 59 190. As far as the Government is concerned, there is no magic number of mobile network operators. Each merger control case should be assessed on its merits at a particular time, by the relevant authorities. The European Commission, supported by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority, rejected a proposed merger of O2 and Three in 2016 because of pricing concerns resulting from a reduction in retail competition; concerns about the impact that a merger of MNOs in different network sharing arrangements would have on innovation and network roll out; and unease that there would be a reduction in wholesale competition with fewer potential hosts for MVNOs.88 191. There can be a tension between incentivising investment (with positive consumer benefits in the longer-term) and protecting consumers from the risk of higher retail prices in the short-term. Some argue that the increased cost efficiencies and increased scale from consolidation would enable greater investment and better consumer outcomes.89 At the same time, other analysis suggests there is no significant difference in industry-level investment between four and three player markets.90 Mobile investment should be closely monitored by Ofcom and appropriate options considered if it were to become clear that the current market structure was not supporting network investment in 5G at sustainable levels.",

They were then more likely to have not considered an upgrade to their connection in the past because it was not available to them, with 81% citing this reason while the rate was 71% in commercial areas. In the non-commercial areas, respondents also reported a higher level of satisfaction with their pre-connection broadband, Generally, people\u2019s awareness of the connection being connected to the Hub investments into nearby public buildings was low (at 9%). However, this knowledge was more common in the remote, non-commercial properties at 12%, being 6% in the commercial areas The marketing of vouchers to residential broadband users is primarily through suppliers, who would then provide the connection and draw the voucher funding. When asked about how beneficiaries heard about the voucher scheme, generally the response that this was from the supplier was high. However, in remote areas in terms of the modelled cost of connecting residences, the households close to a Hub reported hearing about the voucher support through the community over half the time. They were also relatively unaware of the possibility of having a fast connection, assuming they were too remote. The survey also reveals a marginally higher knowledge of the Hub investment in this subsample. Conclusions This chapter presents the results of a survey of residential and business voucher beneficiaries where the connection was near (within a 5km radius) to a Hub. The analysis uses a set of questions that were asked recently in a large survey conducted to evaluate vouchers more generally, and results from that survey provides the potential effect of the Hubs in terms of a comparator. \u25cf Residential survey had 1,518 respondents with 33 follow-up interviews. Residents that live close to a Hub are similar in profile to residents in the comparison sample in terms of age, employment status, household size and income. There were some statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding household type, housing tenure, and occupation. The comparator survey had 1,356 respondents. \u25cf Use of internet similar to non-Hub voucher beneficiaries. The comparison group and the Hubs sample are making greater use of the internet for personal, education and professional purposes. Some small statistically significant differences were found in the data \u2013 a slightly lower proportion of residents in the Hubs sample are making greater use of streaming entertainment services and keeping in touch with family and friends. \u25cf There are community-level networks. Residents close to a Hub were more likely to have heard about the voucher through a local community initiative, and it was less likely to be through a broadband supplier, compared to residents in the voucher sample.

However, the roll out of full fibre will require significant, risky investments in new networks. 107. Investment decisions will likely vary across areas, reflecting the differing cost of rolling out networks \u2013 depending on the type of property, property density, difficulty of accessing roads and sites, and the proximity to existing passive infrastructure \u2013 in different areas. They may also be driven by expectations of the overall level of demand and willingness to pay. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 40 108. This means that while some areas are likely to be commercially attractive for multiple networks to roll out, other areas may only be able to sustain one commercial fibre network, or none at all. Our analysis suggests that there will be three broad zones for fibre roll out: \u2022 Areas that can support commercial roll out of two or more gigabit-capable networks.

The degree of any regulation should be proportionate to the characteristics of the market and competitive conditions \u2013 one would only expect to see regulatory interventions where competition concerns clearly arise. For areas where there is actual or prospective effective competition between networks, we would not anticipate the need for regulation as competitive pressures will shape investment and pricing decisions. For other areas, we would expect the regulatory model to evolve over time as networks are established. If market power emerges, regulated wholesale access (including price controls) may be needed to address competition concerns. However, this may not be necessary in the",

    "What role does passive infrastructure sharing (e.g. ducts and poles) play in the UK's plan for nationwide full fibre deployment, and how does this relate to regulatory goals?": {
        "response": "Passive infrastructure sharing, such as the use of existing ducts and poles, plays a crucial role in the UK's plan for nationwide full fibre deployment. This approach is integral to achieving the regulatory goals of enhancing broadband coverage, promoting competition, and reducing deployment costs. Here\u2019s how passive infrastructure sharing contributes to these objectives:\n\n1. **Cost Reduction**:\n   - By allowing multiple network operators to use existing infrastructure, such as ducts and poles, the cost of deploying new fibre networks is significantly reduced. This is because the need for new civil engineering works, which are typically the most expensive part of network deployment, is minimized.\n\n2. **Accelerated Deployment**:\n   - Sharing existing infrastructure can speed up the deployment process. Network operators can avoid the time-consuming process of obtaining permits and conducting new construction, allowing them to roll out services more quickly.\n\n3. **Promoting Competition**:\n   - Infrastructure sharing lowers the barriers to entry for new market players, fostering a more competitive environment. This can lead to better services and prices for consumers as multiple providers can offer services using the same physical infrastructure.\n\n4. **Efficient Use of Resources**:\n   - By maximizing the use of existing infrastructure, the approach supports efficient resource utilization. This is aligned with environmental goals by reducing the need for new construction and minimizing the environmental impact of network deployment.\n\n5. **Regulatory Goals**:\n   - The UK's regulatory framework, supported by Ofcom, encourages infrastructure sharing as a means to promote competition and innovation in the telecommunications sector. By mandating or facilitating access to existing infrastructure, regulators aim to ensure that all areas, including rural and hard-to-reach locations, can benefit from high-speed broadband services.\n\n6. **Alignment with Government Objectives**:\n   - The UK government\u2019s objectives for full fibre deployment include achieving nationwide coverage and ensuring that the digital infrastructure supports economic growth and social inclusion. Infrastructure sharing is a key strategy in meeting these objectives by making it economically viable to extend networks to less commercially attractive areas.\n\nOverall, passive infrastructure sharing is a strategic component of the UK's broadband policy, helping to achieve regulatory goals of widespread, competitive, and cost-effective full fibre deployment.",

Faster broadband was of growing importance to firms, with greater bandwidth required to take advantage of a range of new digital services and assure reliability and continuity of operations. For residents, ultrafast speeds were needed to support growing demand for data \u2013 for example, content-rich websites, streaming services and cloud services. They were also expected to produce significant social benefits by supporting the development of applications enabling remote service delivery such as remote medical diagnostics.

Key findings are: \u25cf The Hub product invested in connecting public buildings to gigabit capable broadband in areas which will not support commercial roll-out without some kind of subsidy. Between May 2019 and the end of March 2022, 1,021 connections have been made across rural UK. The evidence finds that the selection process did identify such buildings. \u25cf Identification of Hubs was through partnerships between BDUK and a sponsor, such as central government departments and agencies, and local government. This enabled looking across a portfolio of hard-to-connect schools, General Practice (GP) surgeries, libraries and other public buildings and select those needing a connection. The logic of the Hub product is then for the connections to enable the public building to use digital technologies in delivering services, but then also gigabit capable networks closer to businesses and residences in remote areas. \u25cf A final aim is to encourage a more competitive supplier market. Interviews highlight that there are some challenges in this regard, with the selection process using government partners potentially not introducing suppliers early enough to integrate the connections into their wider offer to the area near the Hubs. Some suppliers also noted that the focus on Openreach provisioning the connection meant their onward use to connect businesses and residences would incur Openreach access charges, potentially lessening the incentives for further connections. Delivering broadband connections in rural areas In 2018, the Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review (FTIR) estimated that around 80% of premises in the UK would be commercially viable to support two or more gigabit-capable networks. Around 10% are likely to be \u2018grey areas\u2019, meaning that, whilst they are commercially viable for one operator, there may be a role for Government intervention to ensure investment in these areas to resolve strategic uncertainties, with the final 10% of premises in areas which will not support commercial roll-out without some kind of subsidy. Investing in connecting public buildings is viewed to support this aim, and the RGC programme has provided a pilot to test driving gigabit rollout in the final 20% using investments connecting public sector buildings (Hubs). 21 | P a g e The Hub Product The Hub product was first piloted in the 2017 Local Full Fibre Network programme, where it was Public Sector Building Upgrades. The RGC Programme, beginning in May 2019 and running until the end of March 2021, continued this type of intervention with delivery of the builds to be completed by the end of March 2022.

We have measured a consequential significant change in overall Fibre-To-The-Premise coverage in the first year since completion (2018/19). \u25cf The Trans Pennine Initiative (TPI) funded the placement of gigabit-capable fibre infrastructure along the existing rail route between Manchester and York, in partnership with Network Rail Telecoms. They have used this project to develop a commercial blueprint for use across the UK rail network, enabling suppliers to access trackside fibre to deliver connectivity in some of the remotest locations in the UK. Data within the report highlights that there has been an increase in network providers offering Fibre-To-The-Premise (FTTP) services along the TPI route. 13 This project was an early pathfinder for the GigaHub model, which brings together local public sector customers to create enough broadband demand to reduce the financial risk of building new full fibre networks. The solution is often a public sector network of sites that provide spine and backhaul fibre to a location. OFFICIAL 02/08/2021 Project Gigabit Delivery Plan Summer Update 26 Useful Information Market Reviews In each identified geography or \u2018Lot\u2019, BDUK conducts an Open Market Review to understand from suppliers if there is any current or planned investment over the next three years in broadband infrastructure (Next Generation Access broadband, ultrafast and gigabit-capable). We are in the process of implementing a rolling Open Market Review process, establishing a maintained national view of commercial build plans for the following three years. This will give a more comprehensive up-to-date view of commercial delivery and will avoid the need for having dedicated local Open Market Reviews. This is followed by a Public Review to validate the findings of the Open Market Review and BDUK\u2019s mapping to ensure it correctly represents the information provided by suppliers and to ensure that the right areas are targeted by Project Gigabit subsidy. BDUK invites stakeholders (including the public, businesses, internet service providers and broadband infrastructure operators) to provide us with feedback about the proposed eligible areas for government investment set out in each Public Review document. A list of public reviews can be found at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk- gigabit-programme-public-reviews. Key Eligibility Requirements for Subsidy The outcome of the Open Market Review and Public Review is shown in terms of \u2018White\u2019, \u2018Black\u2019",

This worked well by integrating wider plans of suppliers, managers of public buildings, and the network operators such as Openreach. Selection placed gigabit infrastructure in areas where this was unavailable. There are about 19,000 properties in the 997 postcodes where at least one Hub connection has been provided, and in 2019 none had gigabit availability. By 2022, this has changed with 7,500 properties having gigabit availability. The costs to connect these properties has been modelled, and around half the properties can be connected on a commercial basis (i.e., a broadband provider would bundle in the connection to the premise within a service contract). Rolling out the Hubs has involved a limited number of suppliers. Connections in Hubs have been supplied primarily by Openreach, with a few local suppliers. Suppliers felt their involvement earlier and with more information about the Hub product would have encouraged participation, and generally viewed the related voucher product \u2013 that subsidises individual or groups of connections to residential and business premises \u2013 as more significant in their supplying of connections. Impact on availability and Gigabit uptake at and near the public building A first impact evaluation focus \u2013 on the additional availability and uptake of broadband at the public building \u2013 is on the areas that contained 528 English primary school Hubs. These were statistically 3 The figures stated in this report may not align with BDUK performance report due to differences in methodology. 9 | P a g e matched to areas with similar schools, in terms of size, pupil eligibility for free school meals, share of pupils with special education needs, and where the wider catchment area of the school was similar in terms of socioeconomics and broadband connectivity. Other variables \u2013 such as school expenditure on IT \u2013 were not used, as these were then analysed as outcomes of the Hub investment. Ofcom provides data at postcode level. Postcodes level data makes detection of effects a little easier as postcodes cover a dozen or so properties of which one is the Hub. Postcode analysis finds broadband uptake and performance improvements at the school Hubs, and these are not seen in the postcode areas of comparable schools. There is a 28% improvement in speed of broadband in the 528 postcodes of supported schools. The counterfactual are the postcodes that include comparable schools, and these also see broadband speed changes, but around 35.7% of the changes seen in Hub schools is not seen in these similar schools, with confidence at 10% for the median model.
