        "response": "Based on the document provided, BDUK does not explicitly explain how it classified premises as White, Grey, Black, or Under Review for the Norfolk Public Review. However, the document provides some context around the purpose and eligibility criteria for the Public Review process:\n\n1. The Public Review aims to validate the outcome of BDUK's mapping exercise to ensure it correctly represents the information provided by suppliers during the Open Market Review (OMR) process. This mapping likely classified areas/premises into different categories based on existing or planned broadband coverage.\n\n2. A key purpose is to \"ensure that the right areas are targeted by Project Gigabit subsidy\" (page 4). This suggests that areas without adequate existing or planned commercial broadband rollouts would be targeted for government subsidies.\n\n3. It states that a list of eligible areas for investment will be set out in the Public Review document (page 8), implying areas are being categorized in some way.\n\n4. There are references to maps showing the \"intervention area\" being included in an annex (page 23), which could represent the areas proposed for subsidies.\n\nWhile not explicitly defined, the typical definitions used by BDUK are:\n\n- White areas - No existing or planned commercial broadband coverage\n- Grey areas - Some commercial coverage planned but not comprehensive \n- Black areas - Comprehensive commercial coverage exists or is planned\n\nThe eligibility for subsidies would likely be focused on the White and Grey areas identified through the OMR and mapping process that this Public Review is aiming to validate. However, the specific criteria and categorization method used for Norfolk is not detailed in this particular document.",

        "response": "The document outlines how the UK government's broadband strategy has evolved from the Superfast Broadband Programme to the newer Project Gigabit initiative, incorporating some key lessons:\n\n1. Shift in focus from superfast (30Mbps) to gigabit-capable (1000Mbps) networks:\n- The Superfast Programme aimed to provide superfast 30Mbps speeds nationwide.\n- Project Gigabit has an ambition to deliver nationwide gigabit-capable (1000Mbps) broadband as soon as possible, recognizing the increasing bandwidth needs.\n\n2. Increased funding for hardest to reach areas:\n- Project Gigabit has allocated \u00a35 billion specifically for the hardest to reach parts of the country that are not commercially viable.\n- This is a significant increase from previous programmes aimed at maximizing coverage.\n\n3. Targeting remaining gaps after commercial rollouts:\n- The \u00a390 million additional funding is aimed at extending previous Superfast contracts to reach hardest to reach premises that cannot get 30Mbps speeds, even after commercial deployments.\n- Project Gigabit focuses on areas with market failure where commercial investment is unlikely.\n\n4. Coordination with devolved nations:\n- Project Gigabit is working closely with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to align gigabit delivery approaches across the UK nations.\n- This allows leveraging existing Superfast contracts already delivering gigabit in the nations.\n\n5. Revised subsidy control approach:\n- Lessons about potential market distortions have led to subsidy being designed to target market failures for full coverage while minimizing negative competition impacts.\n- Public procurement regulations will continue to be followed to meet subsidy control requirements.\n\nIn essence, the evolution shows a shift towards prioritizing higher gigabit speeds, increased funding for hardest to reach areas, better coordination across UK nations, and a more nuanced approach to targeted subsidies that avoids crowding out commercial investment.",

        "response": "The document provided does not directly compare the impacts of different procurement models (regional vs local suppliers) on the speed and effectiveness of broadband infrastructure delivery in rural areas. However, it does provide some relevant insights:\n\n1. It highlights challenges with the demand-led broadband interventions in providing additional gigabit-capable networks above what would have happened commercially by 2022. This has limited the longer-term economic, social and environmental benefits expected from the projects.\n\n2. For the \"Hub\" product investing in gigabit connections to public buildings, the evidence finds that selecting the least commercially viable premises first meant those premises received subsidized connectivity before more viable areas.\n\n3. The delivery model builds on the Superfast Broadband Programme approach, which previous evaluations found highly effective in accelerating rural broadband deployment through subsidies.\n\n4. Feedback from telecoms providers indicated a desire from the majority to start local area procurements as soon as possible, though some preferred waiting until live superfast contracts completed first.\n\nWhile not directly comparing regional vs local supplier models, this suggests some potential advantages and disadvantages:\n\nAdvantages of local/demand-led model:\n- Aligns with provider preferences to start local procurements quickly\n- Targets hardest to reach areas first that lack commercial viability\n\nPotential disadvantages:\n- May struggle to deliver gigabit infrastructure beyond what would occur commercially in early stages\n- Limits broader economic benefits in the short-term\n\nThe document implies that building on the centralized Superfast model was seen as an effective way to accelerate rural broadband through subsidies. However, it does not definitively analyze whether a more regional/coordinated supplier approach could deliver better speeds and coverage than relying on more localized demand-led interventions, especially in the early phases.",

        "response": "Based on the document, passive infrastructure sharing, particularly of ducts and poles, plays an important enabling role in the UK's plan for achieving nationwide full fibre broadband deployment. This is tied to the regulatory approach being proposed:\n\n1. The document recognizes that around 10% of premises, often in rural areas, are unlikely to be commercially viable for full fibre deployment by operators alone due to the high costs involved. Government intervention/funding will be required in these areas.\n\n2. However, for the remaining areas, the strategy aims to \"promote competition and commercial investment where possible\" by improving the conditions for large-scale network builds by multiple operators.\n\n3. In this context, the document highlights the importance of changes to the regulatory and policy environment to incentivize this large-scale commercial full fibre deployment across urban and rural areas.\n\n4. Specifically, it endorses the National Infrastructure Commission's recommendation for a \"national full fibre rollout programme\" to achieve nationwide coverage through interventions where required.\n\n5. One of the key regulatory changes proposed is promoting access to Openreach's passive infrastructure like ducts and poles through improved access terms.\n\n6. Enabling easier infrastructure sharing and access is viewed as critical for reducing deployment costs and barriers for operators, thereby extending commercial investment in full fibre as far as possible.\n\n7. This is part of pursuing an \"outside-in\" strategy, targeting the most commercially viable areas first through infrastructure sharing while using subsidies for the final 10% of hardest to reach premises.\n\nSo in summary, while direct subsidies are planned for the most unviable rural areas, enabling passive infrastructure sharing and access is a central regulatory goal. This aims to improve investment conditions and reduce costs for operators, thereby maximizing the coverage achieved through competitive commercial full fibre rollouts before resorting to subsidies in the final areas. Infrastructure sharing enables an outside-in deployment strategy.",
