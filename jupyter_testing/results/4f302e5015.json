This inconsistency, along with the timing of public review publications, created challenges.  The effectiveness of engaging suppliers to ensure interest in the Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy (GIS) procurements was also being evaluated.\n* **Completeness of Responses:**  The evaluation questioned whether all relevant suppliers responded to the OMR and public consultation and if the information provided was accurate.  It also examined how many rejected OMR responses were later accepted.\n* **Local Body Expertise:** The evaluation also considered whether Local Bodies possessed the necessary skills and knowledge to assess the validity of information received.\n* **Responsiveness to Change:** The evaluation questioned the OMR's adaptability to changes in commercial plans, the broader environment, and suppliers' strategic behavior.\n* **Effectiveness of Public Consultation:** The effectiveness of the public consultation in generating valid responses to the OMR was also assessed.  Metrics included the number of responses and the number of valid responses that led to OMR changes.\n* **Clarity of Guidance:** The evaluation also questioned if BDUK's published information and guidance were sufficient for network providers to complete the OMR.\n\nThe text presents these as areas of investigation rather than definitive conclusions. The evaluation sought to measure these aspects using various metrics (indicated by \"X\" placeholders in the original text), but the actual results are not provided.",
