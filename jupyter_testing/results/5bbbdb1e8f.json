This suggests a potential disconnect between the time the review occurred and the reality of the market at the time of the review.\n\n2. **Insufficient evidence of commercial backing:**  Suppliers were frequently not providing enough evidence of commercial backing for their plans.  This led BDUK to amend the OMR guidance to better gather this information.  This highlights a gap in the initial process that potentially made the information gathered less reliable.\n\n3. **Mixed responses from suppliers and local authorities:**  There were mixed responses on their involvement with the OMR process, with some reviewing frequently and others not at all.  This lack of consistent participation could have introduced bias or incomplete data.\n\n4. **Potential for overbuild, and the OMR's role in mitigating it:**  The evaluation notes that the OMR approach used was an improvement in preventing overbuild compared to the Superfast Broadband Programme.  This suggests that the previous approach had potential issues in this regard, and the OMR was intended to improve on it.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation points to issues related to data accuracy, completeness, and consistency in participation across the various stakeholders during the review processes.",
