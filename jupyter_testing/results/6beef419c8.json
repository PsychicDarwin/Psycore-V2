We know the following:\n\n* **Relationship between OMR and BDUK:** BDUK initiated the Open Market Review (OMR), indicating a direct relationship. The Public Review aimed to validate the OMR's findings.\n* **Commercial viability as the key:** Subsidies are for areas *lacking* commercial viability.  The classifications reflect this.\n* **Subsidy implications:** Commercially viable areas (likely Black and Grey, corresponding to 'commercial' in BDUK's internal model) are *ineligible* for subsidy.  Areas deemed not commercially viable (likely White and Under Review) *are* eligible.\n* **Process:**  The OMR collected information from suppliers about planned broadband infrastructure investments over three years.  The Public Review validated this, including how premises (UPRNs) were categorized by both network providers and BDUK.  A later OMR process completed in January 2023 is mentioned, suggesting ongoing reviews.\n\nThe text *does not* specify the precise criteria for each classification. While mentioning feedback including UPRN categorization descriptions, the specific factors (e.g., existing infrastructure, supplier plans, cost projections) remain undefined in this excerpt.
