        "response": "The text states that supporting alternative network operators' market entry and expansion by providing easy access to Openreach's ducts and poles (and other utilities' infrastructure) is crucial for widespread full fiber deployment.  This suggests that passive infrastructure sharing is intended to lower deployment costs and encourage competition, thus increasing the likelihood of full fiber reaching more areas, including those currently deemed commercially unviable.  The implication is that regulatory goals likely include promoting competition and wider access to broadband, which passive infrastructure sharing is meant to achieve.  However, the specific regulatory goals and how they're linked to this strategy aren't detailed.",
