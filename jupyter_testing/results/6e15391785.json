The average cost per premises contracted to be upgraded by Phase is presented in the figure below. This shows that the average cost per premises upgraded has increased by Phase. This is not surprising as the projects maximised the number of premises upgraded, therefore easier / cheaper premises were upgraded first. Additionally, in Phase 3, there was more of a focus on the more expensive FTTP connections (rather than FTTC), which may also contribute to the increase in unit cost. Figure 2.2: Cost per premise upgraded and funding source7 Source: Cora Management Information, June 2020 There are significant differences between the cost per contracted premises by provider and Phase (see the table below). In Phase 1, the cost per premises for BT / OpenReach was relatively low (\u00a3366), but the unit cost to BT / OpenReach increased through the Phases to \u00a31,703 in Phase 3. Similarly, the cost per premises delivered was high for Gigaclear in Phases 2 and 3 (approximately \u00a31,555 to \u00a31,749). The costs to Airband are also relatively high. However, the unit costs to UK Broadband (Relish) and Callflow are low in comparison, at \u00a3253 and \u00a3460 per premises upgraded. 7 Gainshare was an agreement between the programme beneficiary (network provider) and Local Bodies to access the expected clawback monies before the end of the take-up clawback period, with the monies to be used to fund further network upgrades. \u00a3367 \u00a3815 \u00a31,977 \u00a30 \u00a3500 \u00a31,000 \u00a31,500 \u00a32,000 Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 BDUK Local Body ERDF / Defra Supplier Capex Supplier Opex Clawback / gainshare Underspend Ipsos MORI | 18-101398-01 Evaluation of the Superfast Broadband Programme \u2013 Process evaluation report 19 18-101398-01 | FINAL VERSION | | Internal Use Only | This work was carried out in accordance",

It was reported that the alternative approaches to tendering were more resource intensive than the recommended approach. Therefore, it is recommended that Local Bodies follow the approach recommended by BDUK, and that lotting of contracts is utilised where possible, to improve cost effectiveness. Building strong relationships with providers was seen as important to ensuring a good number of responses to tenders issued. 7.1.4 Project delivery and management \u25aa Most Local Bodies had utilised similar project management approaches, with day to day project managers overseen by steering groups / committees and where required support was provided by BDUK. This was described as an appropriate model to manage the contracts by the Local Bodies. A small number of projects described working with the Programme beneficiary as being partnership rather than a client-contractor relationship. These bodies felt they got more out of the provider on the delivery of the project with barriers addressed through close partnership working. This again reinforces that Local Bodies should work hard to develop and maintain relationships with providers. \u25aa The delivery of Phase 3 contracts has been delayed, with roll out behind where providers anticipated it would be. Some of the reasons for this were highlighted as being the capacity of Programme beneficiaries to deliver their contracts, the duration of time required to resolve change requests and the enforcement of milestone zero within contracts. BDUK has been working to develop new approaches to ensure change requests are resolved in a timely manner and this should help to resolve this issue, but Local Bodies also need to ensure that their processes allow for a rapid response to change requests and escalate significant change requests to BDUK expediently. 7.2 Programme outcomes 7.2.1 Market outcomes The key findings from the market analysis undertaken are: \u25aa Phase 3 contracts increased the number of premises passed by Next Generation Access (NGA) services by 2,300 to 16,600 on postcodes benefitting from subsidised coverage by the end of September 2019 (with the weight of evidence to the lower end of this range). The share of the 79,100 premises upgraded by the end of September 2019 that would not have otherwise benefitted from NGA coverage is estimated at between 3 and 21 percent.

The share of the 79,100 premises upgraded by the end of September 2019 that would not have otherwise benefitted from Next Generation Access (NGA) coverage is estimated at between 3 and 21 percent. \u25aa Phase 3 contracts increased the number of premises with superfast availability by 10,800 to 29,300, and the number of premises with Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) coverage by 19,000 to 30,300. The additionality of superfast and FTTP coverage was higher than for NGA coverage at between 14 and 55 percent of premises receiving subsidised coverage. This indicates that some premises benefitting from subsidised upgrades would have otherwise received from NGA coverage that did not deliver superfast speeds. \u25aa The results suggest that the processes used to identify the commercial plans of providers were not fully effective in establishing those premises that would not benefit from commercial deployments in the near term. Several explanations for this emerged from the research, including that their investment cycles were determined over relatively short time horizons (12 to 24 months) which did not match the OMR cycle. \u25aa Most Local Bodies and Superfast Broadband Programme beneficiaries took part in activities to promote the take-up of superfast broadband connections, and as this activity was undertaken in most areas (mainly for Phase 1 and Phase 2 contracts) it is difficult to measure the impact of the activities, although interviewees suggested they felt it was important in raising awareness of superfast connections and encouraging take-up, although there was no quantitative evidence to support this.3 \u25aa Based on projections provided by network providers at the tendering stage, the proposed network build under Phase 3 contracts was expected either to generate losses or to deliver positive rates of return that were substantially lower than the cost of capital faced by the network provider. This indicates that public subsidies would have been needed to create a sufficient economic incentive to deliver these investments. \u25aa While the contracts have proven largely effective in containing subsidies to the minimum needed for the project to go forward, the public sector has incurred opportunity costs by tying 3 BDUK has carried out internal analysis of the factors driving take-up, and a light-touch evaluation of the Superfast Take-up grant in a separate piece of research",

There are very few studies that have sought to examine the cost-effectiveness of broadband Programmes in the EU after delivery had been completed. This may in part be because of a relative lack of public Programmes on the same scale as the Superfast Programme and a consequent lack of published evaluative work. However, there are some examples where the expected unit cost of premises passed has been estimated. It should be noted that these are projected public sector costs per gross premises passed, rather than observed costs. The estimated costs are: 27, 28 \u25aa In Austria, the cost per premises",

However, local authorities also expressed a desire to share more of their local knowledge and data to inform and influence decisions, as described above. Further, some local authorities wanted more transparency around the OMR data or access to the underlying data of the OMR, to see which network providers had coverage, or planned coverage, in particular areas. The local authorities did not know why they were not able to receive this information. BDUK confirmed that this information was not passed to the local authorities. 4.5 Feedback provided to suppliers BDUK provided feedback to all network providers that submitted an OMR response. This happens at every OMR process. However, the feedback happens at two stages for the more recent iterations of the national OMR process. In the two stage feedback process, network providers are first provided with information about all the aspects of their bid, which bits of it comply with the requirements set out by BDUK in the guidance documents, and where they do not why the submission does not comply. Network providers are able to use this feedback to resubmit their OMR submission.

    "How has the UK government's strategy for gigabit-capable broadband evolved from the Superfast Broadband Programme to Project Gigabit, and what lessons have been incorporated into the newer interventions?": {
        "response": "The UK government's strategy for gigabit-capable broadband has evolved from the Superfast Broadband Programme to Project Gigabit by shifting its focus from subsidizing *some* areas to incentivizing *all* areas to achieve near-universal gigabit coverage.\n\nThe Superfast Broadband Programme, while aiming to increase broadband coverage, primarily focused on subsidizing projects in areas where commercial deployment was unlikely.  This often resulted in uneven rollout and higher costs per premise.\n\nProject Gigabit, in contrast, aims to achieve near-universal coverage by encouraging significant commercial investment.  This approach leverages several strategies:\n\n* **Incentivizing commercial providers:**  The government actively engages with telecoms providers and investment funds to encourage more ambitious commercial investment plans, including financial incentives. This contrasts with the more direct subsidy approach of the Superfast program.\n* **\"Barrier-busting\" measures:**  The government has implemented policies and initiatives to address obstacles to commercial investment,  such as regulatory hurdles or issues in specific geographical areas.\n* **Targeted procurements:**  Project Gigabit uses a more targeted approach, including Regional and Local Supplier procurements, to address specific needs and areas, including those previously deemed \"uncommercial\" or \"hard to reach.\"  This suggests a learning from the Superfast program's potential over-reliance on direct subsidies.\n* **Focus on FTTP:**  Project Gigabit seems to prioritize FTTP (Fibre to the Premises) connections over FTTC (Fibre to the Cabinet), reflecting the higher speeds and potential for long-term value associated with FTTP.  The original Superfast program arguably did not always have this focus.\n* **Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS):** The use of a DPS for Local Supplier procurements suggests a more streamlined and responsive procurement process, designed to incentivize quicker deployments.\n\n\nThe lessons incorporated into Project Gigabit seem to be:\n\n* **Leveraging commercial investment:** Recognizing the long-term cost-effectiveness and sustainability of attracting private sector investment over direct subsidies.\n* **Addressing market barriers:**  Acknowledging and proactively addressing the obstacles to commercial deployment in certain areas, which the Superfast program may not have adequately addressed.\n* **Targeted approach:**  Shifting from a broad subsidy approach to a more focused and adaptable strategy to address specific needs and geographical challenges.\n* **Faster deployment:**  Implementing procurement processes that facilitate quicker deployment times, as suggested by the use of DPS for Local Supplier procurements.\n\n\nOverall, the evolution reflects a recognition that a more balanced approach, involving both public and private sector investment, is necessary to achieve near-universal gigabit coverage.  The government has learned from the potential pitfalls of the Superfast program by attempting to create a more favorable environment for commercial deployment.",

In approving a project, the Commission explicitly recognise that the scheme is State aid, but that the benefits from the Programme outweigh the level of market distortion generated by the scheme, following the application of the so-called \u2018balancing test\u2019. In a decision, the Commission give a set of requirements that must be followed precisely in order to comply with State aid norms. 2.2.1 2012 scheme The key aspects of the procurement models under the 2012 scheme were: \u25aa All procurement models were based on an Open Tender Process. The tender process must ensure transparency, non-discriminatory treatment, and objective evaluation criteria, and contracts must be awarded to the most economically advantageous offer. \u25aa A National Procurement Framework (known as Broadband Delivery Framework) was prepared by BDUK with the intention to provide Local Bodies with a panel of potential suppliers.

Key findings are: \u25cf The Hub product invested in connecting public buildings to gigabit capable broadband in areas which will not support commercial roll-out without some kind of subsidy. Between May 2019 and the end of March 2022, 1,021 connections have been made across rural UK. The evidence finds that the selection process did identify such buildings. \u25cf Identification of Hubs was through partnerships between BDUK and a sponsor, such as central government departments and agencies, and local government. This enabled looking across a portfolio of hard-to-connect schools, General Practice (GP) surgeries, libraries and other public buildings and select those needing a connection. The logic of the Hub product is then for the connections to enable the public building to use digital technologies in delivering services, but then also gigabit capable networks closer to businesses and residences in remote areas. \u25cf A final aim is to encourage a more competitive supplier market. Interviews highlight that there are some challenges in this regard, with the selection process using government partners potentially not introducing suppliers early enough to integrate the connections into their wider offer to the area near the Hubs. Some suppliers also noted that the focus on Openreach provisioning the connection meant their onward use to connect businesses and residences would incur Openreach access charges, potentially lessening the incentives for further connections. Delivering broadband connections in rural areas In 2018, the Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review (FTIR) estimated that around 80% of premises in the UK would be commercially viable to support two or more gigabit-capable networks. Around 10% are likely to be \u2018grey areas\u2019, meaning that, whilst they are commercially viable for one operator, there may be a role for Government intervention to ensure investment in these areas to resolve strategic uncertainties, with the final 10% of premises in areas which will not support commercial roll-out without some kind of subsidy. Investing in connecting public buildings is viewed to support this aim, and the RGC programme has provided a pilot to test driving gigabit rollout in the final 20% using investments connecting public sector buildings (Hubs). 21 | P a g e The Hub Product The Hub product was first piloted in the 2017 Local Full Fibre Network programme, where it was Public Sector Building Upgrades. The RGC Programme, beginning in May 2019 and running until the end of March 2021, continued this type of intervention with delivery of the builds to be completed by the end of March 2022. The Hub approach involves identifying demand for gigabit connectivity to meet an area\u2019s",

Rolling out small cells in dense urban areas, which is where MNOs are likely to be most significantly capacity constrained, also appears feasible on a mid-2020s timetable. However, rolling out a more extensive 5G network that meets the needs of all potential use cases, may take considerably longer. 185. Given the greater number of cell sites likely required for 5G over the longer-term, the traditional model of cell deployment is likely to be too expensive and impractical to adopt. Operators will need to work together with local stakeholders to improve processes to enable more efficient small cell deployment. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 58 3.4 What is the best future market model for 5G? 186. The Government\u2019s strategic priority is to promote efficient investment and innovation in 5G, and ensure that 5G deployment can occur at sufficient pace as new use cases and demand materialises. 187. There are a range of alternative market models that could emerge in the UK, with different approaches to service provision, network infrastructure and spectrum authorisation. We have considered three broad potential models and how they might promote 5G investment, innovation and availability: \u2022 Current Model. In this model, there would continue to be multiple vertically integrated national operators, sharing infrastructure through commercial arrangements and supplementing this with the use of independent infrastructure providers. Competition at the retail level would be largely driven by the MNOs, with a degree of wholesale access provision to resellers, including MVNOs. Spectrum authorisation would continue to be on the basis of long-term national licences. \u2022 Single National Wholesale Network. Under this model, a monopoly infrastructure provider would offer a wholesale service to MNOs and other wireless operators, with the aim of reducing costs and improving coverage. Spectrum might be pooled and allocated to the monopoly provider. An example of this model is the \u2018Red Compartida\u2019 or \u2018shared network\u2019 in Mexico. This is a wholesale-only network created as a result of government policy to expand mobile coverage, competition and create an environment for 5G services. \u2022 Market Expansion Model. This relies on competition between multiple national networks but also enables new infrastructure and spectrum access models. In this model, the UK would continue to benefit from network competition between multiple national operators. National networks would be supplemented by \u2018neutral host\u2019 infrastructure and private networks to, for example, deliver small cell deployments in",

Conclusions This chapter looks at the Hubs product, focusing on the Rural Gigabit Connectivity delivery that occurred from 2019-22. It highlights: \u25cf Hub investments until 2022. Delivered through the RGC Programme from May 2019 with completed builds up to March 2022, these have provided 1,021 connections in eligible public buildings, primarily schools and GP surgeries. \u25cf Selecting eligible buildings has focused on areas distant from the gigabit capable network. Public buildings were identified through ten projects led by partner bodies such as local authorities, DfE, devolved administrations, that have prioritised public buildings poorly served by broadband. This worked well by integrating wider plans of suppliers, managers of public buildings, and Openreach. \u25cf The connection is generally provided by Openreach. It is responsible for 791 of the 1,021 Hub connections. There are then some community-based or regional suppliers (such as Fibrus Networks in Northern Ireland). 34 | P a g e \u25cf Suppliers were attracted by the Hub product. It delivered fibre connectivity to rural and deep rural areas and provided a platform for further connections. But they felt that marketing of the Hub investments could be improved by contacting suppliers earlier. Also, the detail of the level of potential funding, timings for applications etc were unclear. \u25cf Delivery is linked to the wider provision of online services in a Hub. This can be managed through an aggregator (common for GP surgeries). Some Hubs experienced delays in delivery and noted information about progress was sometimes limited. \u25cf The logic model envisages spatial effects beyond the supported areas. The anticipated direct benefits are to the public services delivered in the Hubs enabling more digital technology in schools, surgeries etc. But then these connections bring the gigabit- capable network closer to hard-to-reach areas. Suppliers are more likely to be able to meet local residential and business demand for fast broadband. \u25cf Areas supported have low broadband performance and coverage. In 2020, 11.9% of premises in the supported areas have gigabit available, less than half the 27.7% seen in the UK. Download speeds are 42,6 Mbps compared to 72.5 in the wider UK. \u25cf Provision of gigabit capable connections is unlikely on a commercial basis. There are about 19,000 properties in the 997 postcodes where at least one Hub connection has been provided,",

Such infrastructure models could be supported by promoting access to 5G spectrum, through spectrum trading or potentially new spectrum sharing models. At the service level, enhanced mobile broadband services would be provided by MNOs and MVNOs, alongside new services enabled by existing and new players. 3.4.1 How we assessed these models 188. We have considered the potential models against a range of criteria \u2013 including the extent of 5G coverage, the pace of roll out, the costs, the incentives to improve quality and innovation over time, and how feasible it would be to implement the models.87 189. The Government recognises there is a debate about the optimal level of competitive intensity and consolidation in the UK mobile sector, and notes the number of recent mobile merger control cases across Europe, with a range of outcomes. The Government is clear that network competition between MNOs has been an important driver of mobile investment and expects that this will continue to be the case for 5G. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 59 190. As far as the Government is concerned, there is no magic number of mobile network operators. Each merger control case should be assessed on its merits at a particular time, by the relevant authorities. The European Commission, supported by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority, rejected a proposed merger of O2 and Three in 2016 because of pricing concerns resulting from a reduction in retail competition; concerns about the impact that a merger of MNOs in different network sharing arrangements would have on innovation and network roll out; and unease that there would be a reduction in wholesale competition with fewer potential hosts for MVNOs.88 191. There can be a tension between incentivising investment (with positive consumer benefits in the longer-term) and protecting consumers from the risk of higher retail prices in the short-term. Some argue that the increased cost efficiencies and increased scale from consolidation would enable greater investment and better consumer outcomes.89 At the same time, other analysis suggests there is no significant difference in industry-level investment between four and three player markets.90 Mobile investment should be closely monitored by Ofcom and appropriate options considered if it were to become clear that the current market structure was not supporting network investment in 5G at sustainable levels.",

Conclusions This chapter looks at the Hubs product, focusing on the Rural Gigabit Connectivity delivery that occurred from 2019-22. It highlights: \u25cf Hub investments until 2022. Delivered through the RGC Programme from May 2019 with completed builds up to March 2022, these have provided 1,021 connections in eligible public buildings, primarily schools and GP surgeries. \u25cf Selecting eligible buildings has focused on areas distant from the gigabit capable network. Public buildings were identified through ten projects led by partner bodies such as local authorities, DfE, devolved administrations, that have prioritised public buildings poorly served by broadband. This worked well by integrating wider plans of suppliers, managers of public buildings, and Openreach. \u25cf The connection is generally provided by Openreach. It is responsible for 791 of the 1,021 Hub connections. There are then some community-based or regional suppliers (such as Fibrus Networks in Northern Ireland). 34 | P a g e \u25cf Suppliers were attracted by the Hub product. It delivered fibre connectivity to rural and deep rural areas and provided a platform for further connections. But they felt that marketing of the Hub investments could be improved by contacting suppliers earlier. Also, the detail of the level of potential funding, timings for applications etc were unclear. \u25cf Delivery is linked to the wider provision of online services in a Hub. This can be managed through an aggregator (common for GP surgeries). Some Hubs experienced delays in delivery and noted information about progress was sometimes limited. \u25cf The logic model envisages spatial effects beyond the supported areas. The anticipated direct benefits are to the public services delivered in the Hubs enabling more digital technology in schools, surgeries etc. But then these connections bring the gigabit- capable network closer to hard-to-reach areas. Suppliers are more likely to be able to meet local residential and business demand for fast broadband. \u25cf Areas supported have low broadband performance and coverage. In 2020, 11.9% of premises in the supported areas have gigabit available, less than half the 27.7% seen in the UK. Download speeds are 42,6 Mbps compared to 72.5 in the wider UK. \u25cf Provision of gigabit capable connections is unlikely on a commercial basis. There are about 19,000 properties in the 997 postcodes where at least one Hub connection has been provided,",

Rolling out small cells in dense urban areas, which is where MNOs are likely to be most significantly capacity constrained, also appears feasible on a mid-2020s timetable. However, rolling out a more extensive 5G network that meets the needs of all potential use cases, may take considerably longer. 185. Given the greater number of cell sites likely required for 5G over the longer-term, the traditional model of cell deployment is likely to be too expensive and impractical to adopt. Operators will need to work together with local stakeholders to improve processes to enable more efficient small cell deployment. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 58 3.4 What is the best future market model for 5G? 186. The Government\u2019s strategic priority is to promote efficient investment and innovation in 5G, and ensure that 5G deployment can occur at sufficient pace as new use cases and demand materialises. 187. There are a range of alternative market models that could emerge in the UK, with different approaches to service provision, network infrastructure and spectrum authorisation. We have considered three broad potential models and how they might promote 5G investment, innovation and availability: \u2022 Current Model. In this model, there would continue to be multiple vertically integrated national operators, sharing infrastructure through commercial arrangements and supplementing this with the use of independent infrastructure providers. Competition at the retail level would be largely driven by the MNOs, with a degree of wholesale access provision to resellers, including MVNOs. Spectrum authorisation would continue to be on the basis of long-term national licences. \u2022 Single National Wholesale Network. Under this model, a monopoly infrastructure provider would offer a wholesale service to MNOs and other wireless operators, with the aim of reducing costs and improving coverage. Spectrum might be pooled and allocated to the monopoly provider. An example of this model is the \u2018Red Compartida\u2019 or \u2018shared network\u2019 in Mexico. This is a wholesale-only network created as a result of government policy to expand mobile coverage, competition and create an environment for 5G services. \u2022 Market Expansion Model. This relies on competition between multiple national networks but also enables new infrastructure and spectrum access models. In this model, the UK would continue to benefit from network competition between multiple national operators. National networks would be supplemented by \u2018neutral host\u2019 infrastructure and private networks to, for example, deliver small cell deployments in",

Such infrastructure models could be supported by promoting access to 5G spectrum, through spectrum trading or potentially new spectrum sharing models. At the service level, enhanced mobile broadband services would be provided by MNOs and MVNOs, alongside new services enabled by existing and new players. 3.4.1 How we assessed these models 188. We have considered the potential models against a range of criteria \u2013 including the extent of 5G coverage, the pace of roll out, the costs, the incentives to improve quality and innovation over time, and how feasible it would be to implement the models.87 189. The Government recognises there is a debate about the optimal level of competitive intensity and consolidation in the UK mobile sector, and notes the number of recent mobile merger control cases across Europe, with a range of outcomes. The Government is clear that network competition between MNOs has been an important driver of mobile investment and expects that this will continue to be the case for 5G. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 59 190. As far as the Government is concerned, there is no magic number of mobile network operators. Each merger control case should be assessed on its merits at a particular time, by the relevant authorities. The European Commission, supported by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority, rejected a proposed merger of O2 and Three in 2016 because of pricing concerns resulting from a reduction in retail competition; concerns about the impact that a merger of MNOs in different network sharing arrangements would have on innovation and network roll out; and unease that there would be a reduction in wholesale competition with fewer potential hosts for MVNOs.88 191. There can be a tension between incentivising investment (with positive consumer benefits in the longer-term) and protecting consumers from the risk of higher retail prices in the short-term. Some argue that the increased cost efficiencies and increased scale from consolidation would enable greater investment and better consumer outcomes.89 At the same time, other analysis suggests there is no significant difference in industry-level investment between four and three player markets.90 Mobile investment should be closely monitored by Ofcom and appropriate options considered if it were to become clear that the current market structure was not supporting network investment in 5G at sustainable levels.",

This drew primarily on the Connected Nations dataset published by Ofcom which provides postcode level data on superfast and ultrafast availability, FTTP coverage, connections and data usage. Further data was drawn from ThinkBroadband and the published FTTP roll-out plans of Openreach and other telecommunications suppliers to provide local and regional context for the project. Finally, a variety of additional Office for National Statistics data on the evolution of the local economy was drawn on to provide further evidence on local trends on employment growth and unemployment. \u25aa Semi-structured qualitative interviews with project stakeholders: Consultations with stakeholders in the projects were undertaken in between September 2022 and April 2023 to gather views on how the projects had delivered against their intended objectives, the wider impacts achieved, barriers encountered and lessons learned. Stakeholders consulted included project leads and local stakeholders either involved in the delivery of the projects or who benefitted from them. Interviews covered emerging demand for fibre services and connections and impacts of the LFFN project on organisations and the local area. The",

An econometric analysis was undertaken using a fixed effects analytical framework. The analysis compared gigabit-capable and ultrafast availability in the project areas and matched comparator areas. For more details of the analytical approach please see the technical annex for the LFFN wave one evaluations. The impacts are presented in the table below, which suggests that the projects the West Sussex PSAT project and Tameside may have contributed to a slower roll out of gigabit- capable networks in the areas surrounding the project build, but contributed to a faster roll out along the Trans Pennine Initiative route. The analysis also identified significant positive impacts on ultrafast coverage in Tameside and around LFFN schools, with significant negative impacts in the areas surrounding the West Sussex PSAT project and along the Trans Pennine Initiative route. The explanation for these results could be that the subsidised coverage has discouraged other network providers from building in the adjacent area as much as they would have done in the absence of the project, or that roll out is",

        "response": "Passive infrastructure sharing (ducts and poles) is crucial for the UK's nationwide full-fiber deployment plans.  Instead of building entirely new infrastructure, operators can leverage existing ducts and poles, significantly reducing the cost and time required for deployment.  This directly relates to several key regulatory goals:\n\n* **Cost Reduction:**  Sharing passive infrastructure dramatically lowers the overall cost of deployment, potentially leading to lower prices for consumers.  This directly aligns with regulatory goals focused on affordability and accessibility of broadband services.\n\n* **Faster Deployment:**  Reduced infrastructure requirements allow for faster rollout times, meeting regulatory objectives of meeting consumer demand for faster and more reliable connections.\n\n* **Increased Competition:**  Sharing can create opportunities for new entrants and smaller operators to participate in the market, fostering competition and potentially leading to better service options and prices, aligning with regulatory goals promoting competition.\n\n* **Improved Efficiency and Resource Utilization:**  Sharing infrastructure is a more sustainable and efficient use of resources compared to building everything from scratch, which aligns with regulatory goals of sustainability and efficient use of public resources.\n\n* **Future-Proofing:**  The ability to integrate future technologies (like 5G) into existing infrastructure is vital.  Passive infrastructure sharing allows for this convergence of services and technologies, a long-term regulatory goal.\n\n* **Regulatory Efforts:**  Regulatory efforts like unified market reviews and policies promoting unrestricted access to ducts and poles are designed to address potential inefficiencies and barriers to passive infrastructure sharing, further supporting the overall regulatory goal of a smooth and cost-effective nationwide fiber deployment.",

One of the key challenges in building fibre networks that support multiple services (i.e. fixed and 5G) will be to forecast accurately where 5G cell sites will be needed in future. This will be necessary to identify extra fibres and break-out points that can be incorporated into physical networks today, thereby reducing the need for subsequent civil engineering when 5G networks are rolled out. It is important that the networks required for full fibre services are built in ways that can support 5G cells. 236. The Government would like network operators and mobile operators, working with local authorities and other relevant parties, to engage on the likely locations for 5G cell sites, for the purpose of ensuring that fibre networks can be future-proofed.109 237. The Government will support this by ensuring that existing programmes, in particular 5G Trials and Testbeds and LFFN, promote investments that recognise convergence, and use the new Local Connectivity Group to share information from these programmes more widely. 4.2.2 Recognising convergence and considering access network requirements holistically, through unified market reviews 238. Ofcom currently conducts separate market reviews for business connectivity and wholesale local access market (covering homes and small businesses). As wholesale access networks move from copper to fibre, networks are increasingly able to support a range of uses. For example, FTTP networks built for residential broadband can also be used for mobile backhaul. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 71 239. This distinction between markets may lead to inefficient investment decisions. For example, the DPA remedy only applies to the WLA market and can be used only for fibre deployments which are primarily intended for residential or small business use110, but not for fibre networks that serve dedicated mobile backhaul links or core network links for fixed networks. Fibre providers who want to exploit synergies and provide multiple services, including for mobile network backhaul, may therefore be excluded from using DPA, increasing their costs, and increasing the costs of 5G roll out. 240. Ofcom should consider moving to single, unified market reviews. Combined with the availability of longer review periods (outlined in section 2), this would signal a long-term commitment to support infrastructure investment. 4.2.3 Unrestricted access to ducts and poles for all purposes 241.

The changes seen in the supported areas are generally positive in gross terms: there are a greater number of fast broadband connections, download speeds increase and the uptake of voucher connections increases. However, the pace of changes seen is no different to comparable areas, with only three estimates for the additional number of fast connections providing evidence of additional effects. Effects on broadband uptake in postcodes with supported schools Table 3.4 focuses on the postcodes of the supported schools and the counterfactuals. A challenge for the direct effect of the Hub investment on an area is that it is likely to be modest as only one premise is supported in improving their connection. Analysis at the output area level covers many 44 | P a g e premises. In other support measures, such as broadband vouchers, the number of properties that are connected to gigabit capable connections is generally high at OA level. However, only one or sometimes two Hubs are connected in an OA, so the gross direct changes in the Hub areas can be lost in the OA-level area analysis. In the modelling focusing on schools, the postcode for the Hub and that of the school in each of the counterfactual OA can be extracted and then linked to the postcode level data in Connected Nations.

Key findings are: \u25cf The Hub product invested in connecting public buildings to gigabit capable broadband in areas which will not support commercial roll-out without some kind of subsidy. Between May 2019 and the end of March 2022, 1,021 connections have been made across rural UK. The evidence finds that the selection process did identify such buildings. \u25cf Identification of Hubs was through partnerships between BDUK and a sponsor, such as central government departments and agencies, and local government. This enabled looking across a portfolio of hard-to-connect schools, General Practice (GP) surgeries, libraries and other public buildings and select those needing a connection. The logic of the Hub product is then for the connections to enable the public building to use digital technologies in delivering services, but then also gigabit capable networks closer to businesses and residences in remote areas. \u25cf A final aim is to encourage a more competitive supplier market. Interviews highlight that there are some challenges in this regard, with the selection process using government partners potentially not introducing suppliers early enough to integrate the connections into their wider offer to the area near the Hubs. Some suppliers also noted that the focus on Openreach provisioning the connection meant their onward use to connect businesses and residences would incur Openreach access charges, potentially lessening the incentives for further connections. Delivering broadband connections in rural areas In 2018, the Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review (FTIR) estimated that around 80% of premises in the UK would be commercially viable to support two or more gigabit-capable networks. Around 10% are likely to be \u2018grey areas\u2019, meaning that, whilst they are commercially viable for one operator, there may be a role for Government intervention to ensure investment in these areas to resolve strategic uncertainties, with the final 10% of premises in areas which will not support commercial roll-out without some kind of subsidy. Investing in connecting public buildings is viewed to support this aim, and the RGC programme has provided a pilot to test driving gigabit rollout in the final 20% using investments connecting public sector buildings (Hubs). 21 | P a g e The Hub Product The Hub product was first piloted in the 2017 Local Full Fibre Network programme, where it was Public Sector Building Upgrades. The RGC Programme, beginning in May 2019 and running until the end of March 2021, continued this type of intervention with delivery of the builds to be completed by the end of March 2022. The Hub approach involves identifying demand for gigabit connectivity to meet an area\u2019s",

Switchover should be led by industry, working closely with Ofcom and Government. The Government will set up a mechanism with Ofcom and industry for planning the switchover process. Switchover should meet a number of policy conditions: \u2022 Plans support a timely switchover; \u2022 Efficient, so that switchover is smooth with minimal consumer disruption; \u2022 Transparent, so that customers have the information they need to make informed choices and clearly signalled via notice periods so operators have certainty; \u2022 Consistent, with existing regulatory and consumer obligations; \u2022 Pro-competitive, so processes are in place to support easy switching between networks; and \u2022 A fair deal for consumers and adequate safeguards for vulnerable customers. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 48 144. It is realistic to assume that switchover could be underway in the majority of the country by 2030, but the timing will ultimately be dependent on the pace of fibre roll out and subsequent take- up of fibre products.63 We would only expect switchover to start when a significant proportion of the population has taken-up new fibre services. 145. The process would build on the work of industry and Ofcom preparing for the switch-off the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), which is coming to the end of its life. PSTN will be retired by industry by the mid-2020s and be replaced by Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology, which uses a broadband connection to make calls. Industry must ensure a smooth switchover process 146. Industry must be responsible for putting in place robust processes and systems required to support a quick, smooth and hassle-free migration of a large of number of customers from copper to fibre. They will need the capacity to handle a larger than usual number of people switching service and network providers. 147. To aid the migration of customers to fibre networks, we expect that network operators will offer suitable \u2018entry level\u2019 products at prices close to those offered on copper networks.64 This would have the further benefit of protecting the interests of customers who do not want to pay for higher broadband speeds. Internet Service Providers will benefit from operational cost savings from the move to fibre (e.g. fewer faults) and we expect these to be passed on to consumers, reducing any cost increase to end users from switching. However, we note that the incentive to",
