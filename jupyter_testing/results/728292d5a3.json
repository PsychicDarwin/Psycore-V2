The feedback from the OMR included classifications of Unique Property Reference Numbers (UPRNs) by individual network providers, and also by BDUK (as 'white', 'grey', 'black', or 'under review').  \n\nThe text further explains that a subsequent Public Review (August 19th to September 20th, 2021) sought input on the eligibility of these premises for subsidy.  Crucially, the classifications were used to determine if premises were eligible for government subsidy, with 'white' and 'under review' likely representing potentially eligible premises (not commercially viable and requiring intervention), and 'black' and 'grey' representing commercially viable premises (not requiring subsidy).\n\nThe document also notes that BDUK's internal model for classifying uncommercial premises in January 2023 mapped 'commercial' premises to 'black' and 'grey' in the OMR process, while 'white' and 'under review' corresponded to uncommercial premises.  This mapping clarifies the relationship between the internal BDUK model and the OMR process.",

Key differences and lessons learned are:\n\n* **Initial Market Structure:** The Superfast Programme initially used a framework contract, awarding most contracts to existing providers.  This reflected a limited UK market with fewer providers.\n\n* **Later Rounds:**  Later stages of Superfast allowed alternative network providers (alt-net) to bid, indicating a more competitive market.\n\n* **Project Gigabit's Approach:** Project Gigabit aims for nationwide coverage, working with devolved administrations.  It appears to be more open and competitive, focusing on existing gigabit-capable networks (overbuilding) as well as building new infrastructure.\n\n* **Broader Scope:** Project Gigabit's scope extends beyond the initial focus on broadband; it recognizes the potential for gigabit-capable broadband across the UK's economy and society.\n\n* **Data Collection:**  Project Gigabit is gathering data from telecom providers to assess infrastructure coverage.  This suggests a more data-driven approach in contrast to the earlier approach which may have been more reliant on a more limited number of existing providers.\n\n* **Lessons learned:** The text highlights that the market context has changed since the Superfast program.  The original framework contract approach was suitable for a less competitive market, but the new approach incorporates greater competition and data collection to address a more mature market.",
