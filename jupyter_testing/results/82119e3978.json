Further criteria include value for money, and deliverability within the timescales of the programme. Identifying eligible public buildings has been key. BDUK worked with strategic partners, including the Department for Education (DfE) and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), as well as Devolved Administrations and Local Authorities. These partners identified eligible rural public sector buildings to act as Hubs. The lists were then tested using the criteria, with delivery commencing in 2019 but reaching a high level in 2021. Related BDUK and other interventions The evaluation is in the context of complementary policies. The Hubs provide a fast connection in a public building, such as a school. There is then support for the services provided in Hubs to use 16 | P a g e digital technologies. For example, funding is allotted by DfE for educational technologies in classrooms through the Connect the Classroom (CTC) Programme. There is a range of health and care services delivered using digital technologies that are being promoted in the National Health Service (NHS), as well as improvements in record management and administrative functions. Devolved administrations are also at the forefront of similar initiatives for Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Some of these policies include investments in faster connections, but many complement this, relying on the premises used for delivering public services securing adequate connectivity, A related BDUK intervention, the Gigabit Broadband Voucher Scheme (GBVS), encourages greater take-up of gigabit-capable connectivity by residents and businesses. There has been a parallel Rural Gigabit Connectivity voucher scheme in rural areas. These are demand-side products, meaning that they are designed to stimulate demand for broadband connectivity: the vouchers are worth up to \u00a32,500 to businesses and residents to cover the cost of installing gigabit-capable broadband. Many local authorities provide additional funding for businesses to help them upgrade to faster internet connections, alongside BDUK voucher schemes. Eligible businesses received additional funding of up to \u00a33,000 to top up the existing gigabit voucher so that businesses could potentially receive up to \u00a35,500 towards the cost of upgrading to a gigabit-capable connection. Evaluation aims and objectives The evaluation primarily focuses on the effects of the Hub and what impacts are attributable to the policy. As the Hub product is within a wider",

By 2022, this has changed with 7,500 properties having gigabit availability, and this being split evenly between commercial and non- commercial premises. However, over 80% of the properties that do not have access to gigabit broadband are in the non-commercial category. 35 | P a g e 3. Effects of Hubs on Broadband The Hub product aims to widen and improve broadband coverage in rural areas, alongside other policies targeting remote areas, such as recent voucher support. This chapter looks at the effects of the Hub on broadband. Its focus is whether nearby broadband effects occur and can be attributed to the Hub. To estimate the impact of the Hubs support, non-recipient areas who are as comparable as possible to the recipient areas \u2013 called the counterfactual \u2013 are explored seeing if the changes seen in the Hub areas differ. Any differences can be attributed to the Hub product in a causal sense, but ensuring the quality of the counterfactual is key. Challenges in identifying a comparison group of areas include untangling the effects of Hubs from other support and wider broadband investments or dealing with the possibility that Hubs have been delivered in all remote public buildings, exhausting the potential comparable areas. Key findings: \u25cf Hubs are positively affecting availability of gigabit. There are 14.3 more premises passed by gigabit capability in the year after the Hub investment in supported areas and this is 7 more than in comparable OAs with schools. Gigabit availability is rising quicker than comparable OAs in the year after support, with around half (51.3%) of the 64% rise in the premises additional in the supported areas. Around a third of the 9.3 rise in premises connected to ultrafast broadband in supported OAs is additional. \u25cf Postcode analysis finds broadband take up and performance improvements due to Hubs. Some part of the 28% improvement in speed of broadband in the postcodes that contain supported schools can be attributed to the Hub investment. The counterfactual postcodes include schools see broadband speed changes, but around 35.7% of the changes seen in Hub schools is not seen in these similar areas. \u25cf At output area level, take up changes are positive but not significantly different to comparable areas. The use of vouchers, the change in broadband speed and the number of fast connections increases in supported areas but not at rates different from the counterfactual areas.",

        "response": "The UK government's gigabit broadband strategy has evolved from the Superfast Broadband Programme to Project Gigabit by shifting its focus to harder-to-reach areas, seeking more advanced gigabit-capable technologies, and introducing more localized procurement strategies.  Project Gigabit prioritizes areas currently lacking superfast broadband (30Mbps) and actively targets the devolved nations and specific pockets within England.  This strategy is complemented by a more nuanced approach to procurement, including local supplier contracts designed for smaller geographical areas and a dynamic purchasing system.  Project Gigabit also employs more comprehensive market reviews (Open Market Reviews and Public Reviews) to ensure alignment with commercial investment plans and gather public input.  A critical aspect of the evolution is the incorporation of stricter subsidy control mechanisms, aligning with the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) to avoid market distortion.  The strategy also emphasizes Fibre-to-the-Premises (FTTP) technology and collaborative projects like the GigaHub model, involving the public sector to stimulate demand and reduce financial risks.  These changes suggest the government has learned from the Superfast program and aims for wider coverage, greater community involvement, and a more efficient and sustainable approach to deploying gigabit-capable broadband infrastructure.",

The TCA places an obligation on both the UK and EU to have an effective system of subsidy control with independent oversight. BDUK will ensure that it meets these subsidy principles in awarding public subsidy for gigabit- capable broadband infrastructure, for example, by ensuring subsidy is designed to target failure in the market to achieve full UK coverage while minimising negative effects on competition. Public subsidy will be targeted to limit the risks of crowding out private investment, altering commercial investment incentives and ultimately distorting competition. Projects will continue to be procured under the Public Contracts Regulations (2020), to help meet our subsidy control requirements. Suppliers have the opportunity during the OMR and Public Review stages, to share with BDUK any firm and credible investment plans that may mean that public subsidy will not be warranted. Requesting a review of a subsidy award Under UK subsidy control requirements, anyone can request for a review about the award of subsidy. Requests must be submitted no later than one month from the date of the award of the subsidy for Norfolk. The award of subsidy will follow the procurement and contract award and BDUK\u2019s National Competency Centre will consider requests submitted within the one- month timescale, under the terms of the TCA. This proposed award will be published by the Department of Business Energy Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The process for making such a request will be published here too.

We have measured a consequential significant change in overall Fibre-To-The-Premise coverage in the first year since completion (2018/19). \u25cf The Trans Pennine Initiative (TPI) funded the placement of gigabit-capable fibre infrastructure along the existing rail route between Manchester and York, in partnership with Network Rail Telecoms. They have used this project to develop a commercial blueprint for use across the UK rail network, enabling suppliers to access trackside fibre to deliver connectivity in some of the remotest locations in the UK. Data within the report highlights that there has been an increase in network providers offering Fibre-To-The-Premise (FTTP) services along the TPI route. 13 This project was an early pathfinder for the GigaHub model, which brings together local public sector customers to create enough broadband demand to reduce the financial risk of building new full fibre networks.

This will give a more comprehensive up-to-date view of commercial delivery and will avoid the need for having dedicated local Open Market Reviews. This is followed by a Public Review to validate the findings of the Open Market Review and BDUK\u2019s mapping to ensure it correctly represents the information provided by suppliers and to ensure that the right areas are targeted by Project Gigabit subsidy. BDUK invites stakeholders (including the public, businesses, internet service providers and broadband infrastructure operators) to provide us with feedback about the proposed eligible areas for government investment set out in each Public Review document. A list of public reviews can be found at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk- gigabit-programme-public-reviews. Key Eligibility Requirements for Subsidy The outcome of the Open Market Review and Public Review is shown in terms of \u2018White\u2019, \u2018Black\u2019",

Such infrastructure models could be supported by promoting access to 5G spectrum, through spectrum trading or potentially new spectrum sharing models. At the service level, enhanced mobile broadband services would be provided by MNOs and MVNOs, alongside new services enabled by existing and new players. 3.4.1 How we assessed these models 188. We have considered the potential models against a range of criteria \u2013 including the extent of 5G coverage, the pace of roll out, the costs, the incentives to improve quality and innovation over time, and how feasible it would be to implement the models.87 189. The Government recognises there is a debate about the optimal level of competitive intensity and consolidation in the UK mobile sector, and notes the number of recent mobile merger control cases across Europe, with a range of outcomes. The Government is clear that network competition between MNOs has been an important driver of mobile investment and expects that this will continue to be the case for 5G. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 59 190. As far as the Government is concerned, there is no magic number of mobile network operators. Each merger control case should be assessed on its merits at a particular time, by the relevant authorities. The European Commission, supported by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority, rejected a proposed merger of O2 and Three in 2016 because of pricing concerns resulting from a reduction in retail competition; concerns about the impact that a merger of MNOs in different network sharing arrangements would have on innovation and network roll out; and unease that there would be a reduction in wholesale competition with fewer potential hosts for MVNOs.88 191. There can be a tension between incentivising investment (with positive consumer benefits in the longer-term) and protecting consumers from the risk of higher retail prices in the short-term. Some argue that the increased cost efficiencies and increased scale from consolidation would enable greater investment and better consumer outcomes.89 At the same time, other analysis suggests there is no significant difference in industry-level investment between four and three player markets.90 Mobile investment should be closely monitored by Ofcom and appropriate options considered if it were to become clear that the current market structure was not supporting network investment in 5G at sustainable levels.",

For example, while gigabit capable connections to public buildings are being delivered through Hub investments, the extent to which indirect connections to residential and business premises are enabled by the Hub requires controlling for the popular voucher products that are targeting similar areas to the Hubs. Untangling the effects of each policy is difficult and this challenge has led to the study collecting/compiling datasets in a manner that can be analysed controlling for the vouchers policy specifically. For the business and residential survey, the focus was on voucher beneficiaries near Hubs, allowing a comparison with the wider set of voucher survey responses. In compiling data about the support provided in areas, the study has benefited from the management information about the vouchers provided. Structure of the report The remaining chapters in the report cover: Chapter 2: RGC Hubs Product Logic and Delivery. General background about the policy, including the \u201clollipop model\u201d of the spatial effects of the Hubs policy. Chapter 3: Effects of Hubs on Broadband.

                "text": ", as shown in Table 5.1 below. There were a variety of reasons for the slow progress which are discussed in the individual project evaluation reports. Some of these can be assigned to the innovative nature of the projects, and involving organisations with limited experience of delivery publicly funded telecommunications projects. However, one of the key findings across the projects was importance of early planning in ensuring civil engineering work could take place as anticipated. Instances where early planning proved beneficial included applying for wayleaves, exploring the route, and engagement with beneficiaries. The delay in the delivery of the projects, and some difficulties undertaking activities post build, like connecting building, or undertaking marketing due to COVID-19, has led to evaluation challenges, in that the projects have not moved as far along their logic chains as may be expected. Therefore, it is still possible that some of the longer-term outcomes and impacts for the projects could be realised in the future and it is still early to form conclusions about wider impact of some projects.

However, the overall impact on speed and effectiveness is complex and depends heavily on factors beyond just the procurement model itself, such as early planning in civil engineering, the impact of events like COVID-19, and the need for detailed project outcomes comparisons.  The text suggests a potential link between local contracts and faster results in specific rural areas, but it also highlights the importance of other factors that influence the implementation of projects and the ultimate speed and effectiveness of rural broadband delivery.

Such infrastructure models could be supported by promoting access to 5G spectrum, through spectrum trading or potentially new spectrum sharing models. At the service level, enhanced mobile broadband services would be provided by MNOs and MVNOs, alongside new services enabled by existing and new players. 3.4.1 How we assessed these models 188. We have considered the potential models against a range of criteria \u2013 including the extent of 5G coverage, the pace of roll out, the costs, the incentives to improve quality and innovation over time, and how feasible it would be to implement the models.87 189. The Government recognises there is a debate about the optimal level of competitive intensity and consolidation in the UK mobile sector, and notes the number of recent mobile merger control cases across Europe, with a range of outcomes. The Government is clear that network competition between MNOs has been an important driver of mobile investment and expects that this will continue to be the case for 5G. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 59 190. As far as the Government is concerned, there is no magic number of mobile network operators. Each merger control case should be assessed on its merits at a particular time, by the relevant authorities. The European Commission, supported by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority, rejected a proposed merger of O2 and Three in 2016 because of pricing concerns resulting from a reduction in retail competition; concerns about the impact that a merger of MNOs in different network sharing arrangements would have on innovation and network roll out; and unease that there would be a reduction in wholesale competition with fewer potential hosts for MVNOs.88 191. There can be a tension between incentivising investment (with positive consumer benefits in the longer-term) and protecting consumers from the risk of higher retail prices in the short-term. Some argue that the increased cost efficiencies and increased scale from consolidation would enable greater investment and better consumer outcomes.89 At the same time, other analysis suggests there is no significant difference in industry-level investment between four and three player markets.90 Mobile investment should be closely monitored by Ofcom and appropriate options considered if it were to become clear that the current market structure was not supporting network investment in 5G at sustainable levels.",

Conclusions This chapter looks at the Hubs product, focusing on the Rural Gigabit Connectivity delivery that occurred from 2019-22. It highlights: \u25cf Hub investments until 2022. Delivered through the RGC Programme from May 2019 with completed builds up to March 2022, these have provided 1,021 connections in eligible public buildings, primarily schools and GP surgeries. \u25cf Selecting eligible buildings has focused on areas distant from the gigabit capable network. Public buildings were identified through ten projects led by partner bodies such as local authorities, DfE, devolved administrations, that have prioritised public buildings poorly served by broadband. This worked well by integrating wider plans of suppliers, managers of public buildings, and Openreach. \u25cf The connection is generally provided by Openreach. It is responsible for 791 of the 1,021 Hub connections. There are then some community-based or regional suppliers (such as Fibrus Networks in Northern Ireland). 34 | P a g e \u25cf Suppliers were attracted by the Hub product. It delivered fibre connectivity to rural and deep rural areas and provided a platform for further connections. But they felt that marketing of the Hub investments could be improved by contacting suppliers earlier. Also, the detail of the level of potential funding, timings for applications etc were unclear. \u25cf Delivery is linked to the wider provision of online services in a Hub. This can be managed through an aggregator (common for GP surgeries). Some Hubs experienced delays in delivery and noted information about progress was sometimes limited. \u25cf The logic model envisages spatial effects beyond the supported areas. The anticipated direct benefits are to the public services delivered in the Hubs enabling more digital technology in schools, surgeries etc. But then these connections bring the gigabit- capable network closer to hard-to-reach areas. Suppliers are more likely to be able to meet local residential and business demand for fast broadband. \u25cf Areas supported have low broadband performance and coverage. In 2020, 11.9% of premises in the supported areas have gigabit available, less than half the 27.7% seen in the UK. Download speeds are 42,6 Mbps compared to 72.5 in the wider UK. \u25cf Provision of gigabit capable connections is unlikely on a commercial basis. There are about 19,000 properties in the 997 postcodes where at least one Hub connection has been provided,",

This reflects the fact that some of the processes and the number of providers delivering Superfast Broadband Programme contracts have changed between Phases 1 and 2 and Phase 3 of the Programme. However, the process evaluation includes descriptions and assessments of the processes used in the earlier phases of the Programme, to inform why the processes used in Phase 3 have been implemented and how successful they have been. 1.2 Methodology The findings presented in this paper are based on information collected and analysed using the following approaches: \u25aa A review of project information and literature, and interviews with five members of BDUK staff (Programme lead, Programme financial officer and project directors) to develop an understanding of how the Programme operates (June to July 2019); \u25aa Interviews with Local Bodies delivering local Superfast Broadband Projects (31 interviews), undertaken over the phone or by teleconferencing facilities, to collect information about how the projects have been delivered and the outcomes and impacts achieved by the projects in their local area (October 2019 to January 2020). These projects were sampled from areas which had been awarded Phase 3 contracts at the time of sampling; \u25aa Interviews with telecommunication providers (16 interviews), undertaken over the phone or by teleconferencing facilities, to explore how providers engaged",

They were then more likely to have not considered an upgrade to their connection in the past because it was not available to them, with 81% citing this reason while the rate was 71% in commercial areas. In the non-commercial areas, respondents also reported a higher level of satisfaction with their pre-connection broadband, Generally, people\u2019s awareness of the connection being connected to the Hub investments into nearby public buildings was low (at 9%). However, this knowledge was more common in the remote, non-commercial properties at 12%, being 6% in the commercial areas The marketing of vouchers to residential broadband users is primarily through suppliers, who would then provide the connection and draw the voucher funding. When asked about how beneficiaries heard about the voucher scheme, generally the response that this was from the supplier was high. However, in remote areas in terms of the modelled cost of connecting residences, the households close to a Hub reported hearing about the voucher support through the community over half the time. They were also relatively unaware of the possibility of having a fast connection, assuming they were too remote. The survey also reveals a marginally higher knowledge of the Hub investment in this subsample. Conclusions This chapter presents the results of a survey of residential and business voucher beneficiaries where the connection was near (within a 5km radius) to a Hub. The analysis uses a set of questions that were asked recently in a large survey conducted to evaluate vouchers more generally, and results from that survey provides the potential effect of the Hubs in terms of a comparator. \u25cf Residential survey had 1,518 respondents with 33 follow-up interviews. Residents that live close to a Hub are similar in profile to residents in the comparison sample in terms of age, employment status, household size and income. There were some statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding household type, housing tenure, and occupation. The comparator survey had 1,356 respondents. \u25cf Use of internet similar to non-Hub voucher beneficiaries. The comparison group and the Hubs sample are making greater use of the internet for personal, education and professional purposes. Some small statistically significant differences were found in the data \u2013 a slightly lower proportion of residents in the Hubs sample are making greater use of streaming entertainment services and keeping in touch with family and friends. \u25cf There are community-level networks. Residents close to a Hub were more likely to have heard about the voucher through a local community initiative, and it was less likely to be through a broadband supplier, compared to residents in the voucher sample.

This could only be realistically assessed if BDUK was able to monitor revenues earned by network providers alongside customer volumes (as this would help explore issues in relation to both market share and prices). It should be noted that this issue is likely to be more significant for vertically integrated operators that act as both wholesalers and retailers. 4.5.1 Market position of beneficiaries When examining the market position of the Programme beneficiaries, it can be seen that there has not been significant changes in the market share of Programme beneficiaries in the broadband market between 2016 and 2020, with Openreach dominating the market, with more than three quarters of the total broadband market and over 60 percent of the NGA market in both 2016 and 2020. The other Programme beneficiaries cumulatively make up less than 0.5 percent of the total broadband and NGA markets. There appears to have been a decrease in the market share of Virgin Media in the total broadband market (not a Programme beneficiary), but this market share appears to have been taken by non-beneficiary network providers. In the areas where the Superfast Broadband Programme has been delivered, the Programme appears to have had little impact on the market position of Openreach in either the overall broadband or NGA market as Openreach maintains a dominant market position in both 2016 and 2020. However, the market share in both the overall broadband and NGA market for the",

We have measured a consequential significant change in overall Fibre-To-The-Premise coverage in the first year since completion (2018/19). \u25cf The Trans Pennine Initiative (TPI) funded the placement of gigabit-capable fibre infrastructure along the existing rail route between Manchester and York, in partnership with Network Rail Telecoms. They have used this project to develop a commercial blueprint for use across the UK rail network, enabling suppliers to access trackside fibre to deliver connectivity in some of the remotest locations in the UK. Data within the report highlights that there has been an increase in network providers offering Fibre-To-The-Premise (FTTP) services along the TPI route. 13 This project was an early pathfinder for the GigaHub model, which brings together local public sector customers to create enough broadband demand to reduce the financial risk of building new full fibre networks.

We are in the process of implementing a rolling Open Market Review process, establishing a maintained national view of commercial build plans for the following three years. This will give a more comprehensive up-to-date view of commercial delivery and will avoid the need for having dedicated local Open Market Reviews. This is followed by a Public Review to validate the findings of the Open Market Review and BDUK\u2019s mapping to ensure it correctly represents the information provided by suppliers and to ensure that the right areas are targeted by Project Gigabit subsidy. BDUK invites stakeholders (including the public, businesses, internet service providers and broadband infrastructure operators) to provide us with feedback about the proposed eligible areas for government investment set out in each Public Review document.

By 2022, this has changed with 7,500 properties having gigabit availability, and this being split evenly between commercial and non- commercial premises. However, over 80% of the properties that do not have access to gigabit broadband are in the non-commercial category. 35 | P a g e 3. Effects of Hubs on Broadband The Hub product aims to widen and improve broadband coverage in rural areas, alongside other policies targeting remote areas, such as recent voucher support. This chapter looks at the effects of the Hub on broadband. Its focus is whether nearby broadband effects occur and can be attributed to the Hub. To estimate the impact of the Hubs support, non-recipient areas who are as comparable as possible to the recipient areas \u2013 called the counterfactual \u2013 are explored seeing if the changes seen in the Hub areas differ. Any differences can be attributed to the Hub product in a causal sense, but ensuring the quality of the counterfactual is key. Challenges in identifying a comparison group of areas include untangling the effects of Hubs from other support and wider broadband investments or dealing with the possibility that Hubs have been delivered in all remote public buildings, exhausting the potential comparable areas. Key findings: \u25cf Hubs are positively affecting availability of gigabit. There are 14.3 more premises passed by gigabit capability in the year after the Hub investment in supported areas and this is 7 more than in comparable OAs with schools. Gigabit availability is rising quicker than comparable OAs in the year after support, with around half (51.3%) of the 64% rise in the premises additional in the supported areas. Around a third of the 9.3 rise in premises connected to ultrafast broadband in supported OAs is additional. \u25cf Postcode analysis finds broadband take up and performance improvements due to Hubs. Some part of the 28% improvement in speed of broadband in the postcodes that contain supported schools can be attributed to the Hub investment. The counterfactual postcodes include schools see broadband speed changes, but around 35.7% of the changes seen in Hub schools is not seen in these similar areas. \u25cf At output area level, take up changes are positive but not significantly different to comparable areas. The use of vouchers, the change in broadband speed and the number of fast connections increases in supported areas but not at rates different from the counterfactual areas.",
