This suggests a lesson learned from the Superfast program, perhaps where concerns about competition were not adequately addressed.\n\n* **Leveraging Existing Investments:** Project Gigabit extends contracts from the Superfast program, suggesting a recognition of the value of building on existing infrastructure and investment rather than starting from scratch, a more efficient approach.\n\n* **Collaboration with Devolved Administrations:**  The text highlights working closely with devolved administrations, indicating a more collaborative and regionally responsive approach, likely a learned lesson from previous programs.\n\nWhile the text outlines some changes in strategy, it doesn't detail specific lessons learned.
