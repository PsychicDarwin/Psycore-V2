The average cost per premises contracted to be upgraded by Phase is presented in the figure below. This shows that the average cost per premises upgraded has increased by Phase. This is not surprising as the projects maximised the number of premises upgraded, therefore easier / cheaper premises were upgraded first. Additionally, in Phase 3, there was more of a focus on the more expensive FTTP connections (rather than FTTC), which may also contribute to the increase in unit cost. Figure 2.2: Cost per premise upgraded and funding source7 Source: Cora Management Information, June 2020 There are significant differences between the cost per contracted premises by provider and Phase (see the table below). In Phase 1, the cost per premises for BT / OpenReach was relatively low (\u00a3366), but the unit cost to BT / OpenReach increased through the Phases to \u00a31,703 in Phase 3. Similarly, the cost per premises delivered was high for Gigaclear in Phases 2 and 3 (approximately \u00a31,555 to \u00a31,749). The costs to Airband are also relatively high. However, the unit costs to UK Broadband (Relish) and Callflow are low in comparison, at \u00a3253 and \u00a3460 per premises upgraded. 7 Gainshare was an agreement between the programme beneficiary (network provider) and Local Bodies to access the expected clawback monies before the end of the take-up clawback period, with the monies to be used to fund further network upgrades. \u00a3367 \u00a3815 \u00a31,977 \u00a30 \u00a3500 \u00a31,000 \u00a31,500 \u00a32,000 Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 BDUK Local Body ERDF / Defra Supplier Capex Supplier Opex Clawback / gainshare Underspend Ipsos MORI | 18-101398-01 Evaluation of the Superfast Broadband Programme \u2013 Process evaluation report 19 18-101398-01 | FINAL VERSION | | Internal Use Only | This work was carried out in accordance",

It was reported that the alternative approaches to tendering were more resource intensive than the recommended approach. Therefore, it is recommended that Local Bodies follow the approach recommended by BDUK, and that lotting of contracts is utilised where possible, to improve cost effectiveness. Building strong relationships with providers was seen as important to ensuring a good number of responses to tenders issued. 7.1.4 Project delivery and management \u25aa Most Local Bodies had utilised similar project management approaches, with day to day project managers overseen by steering groups / committees and where required support was provided by BDUK. This was described as an appropriate model to manage the contracts by the Local Bodies. A small number of projects described working with the Programme beneficiary as being partnership rather than a client-contractor relationship. These bodies felt they got more out of the provider on the delivery of the project with barriers addressed through close partnership working. This again reinforces that Local Bodies should work hard to develop and maintain relationships with providers. \u25aa The delivery of Phase 3 contracts has been delayed, with roll out behind where providers anticipated it would be. Some of the reasons for this were highlighted as being the capacity of Programme beneficiaries to deliver their contracts, the duration of time required to resolve change requests and the enforcement of milestone zero within contracts. BDUK has been working to develop new approaches to ensure change requests are resolved in a timely manner and this should help to resolve this issue, but Local Bodies also need to ensure that their processes allow for a rapid response to change requests and escalate significant change requests to BDUK expediently. 7.2 Programme outcomes 7.2.1 Market outcomes The key findings from the market analysis undertaken are: \u25aa Phase 3 contracts increased the number of premises passed by Next Generation Access (NGA) services by 2,300 to 16,600 on postcodes benefitting from subsidised coverage by the end of September 2019 (with the weight of evidence to the lower end of this range). The share of the 79,100 premises upgraded by the end of September 2019 that would not have otherwise benefitted from NGA coverage is estimated at between 3 and 21 percent.

There are very few studies that have sought to examine the cost-effectiveness of broadband Programmes in the EU after delivery had been completed. This may in part be because of a relative lack of public Programmes on the same scale as the Superfast Programme and a consequent lack of published evaluative work. However, there are some examples where the expected unit cost of premises passed has been estimated. It should be noted that these are projected public sector costs per gross premises passed, rather than observed costs. The estimated costs are: 27, 28 \u25aa In Austria, the cost per premises",

Building Digital UK 2023 42 Ipsos | Evaluation of the Local Full Fibre Network wave one projects: Trans Pennine Initiative 6 Conclusions The key findings from the Trans Pennine Initiative evaluation are: \u25aa The physical works were completed in December 2019, with a core fibre optical cable installed and operational between Manchester and York, and connected to two internet exchanges. Nine Fibre Interface Points have been installed along the route, with a further three in development. Network Rail or a third party partner have the opportunity to install further Fibre Interface Points along the route if there is a commercially viable reason for doing so. \u25aa Marketing and promotion of the Trans Pennine Initiative product proved challenging for Network Rail, due to the price constraints and the launch of a new Openreach dark fibre product around the same time as their marketing activity. The project was able to generate 74 potential customers, but of these only five were converted into sales. This shows that there are significant challenges to marketing the trackside fibre in this way. \u25aa As a result of the lessons learned from the Trans Pennine Initiative project, Network Rail have altered their commercial approach to trackside fibre. The lessons learned were around the need to have telecommunications specialists involved to sell access to dark fibre products, as the Trans Pennine Initiative struggled to gain traction in this area. In 2021, they launched Project Reach, which offers a commercial provider access to trackside fibre, in exchange for the capital investment to construct the trackside fibre network. \u25aa Deployment of gigabit-capable networks within 1km of the Trans Pennine Initiative route has increased between 2017 and 2022. The econometric analysis undertaken, comparing connectivity outcomes along the Trans Pennine Initiative route and the Reading to Bristol rail route indicates that the project has had a positive impact on gigabit-capable coverage and take-up of ultrafast broadband connections. This is despite there being a limited number of network providers actually using the Trans Pennine Initiative network to provide broadband services. The table",

        "response": "Based on the information provided in the sources, the UK government's strategy for delivering gigabit-capable broadband has evolved from the earlier Superfast Broadband Programme to the newer Project Gigabit in a few key ways:\n\n1. Shift in focus from superfast (30Mbps+) to gigabit-capable (1Gbps+) networks\nThe Superfast Broadband Programme primarily focused on delivering superfast broadband speeds of at least 30Mbps, achieved largely through fibre-to-the-cabinet (FTTC) technology. Project Gigabit aims for nationwide gigabit-capable networks, enabled by full fibre deployment.\n\n2. Targeting the hardest-to-reach premises\nWhile the Superfast Programme upgraded many urban and semi-urban areas, Project Gigabit is specifically targeting the 20% of premises in the most rurally isolated areas that are unlikely to benefit from commercial full fibre rollout.\n\n3. Learning from Open Market Reviews \nThe Public Reviews under Project Gigabit incorporate lessons from the Open Market Review process used in the Superfast Programme to better identify areas that lack adequate commercial investment plans and thus require public subsidy.\n\n4. New commercial models\nProject Gigabit is exploring alternative commercial models like GigaHubs (public sector networks to drive demand) and the Network Rail partnership (leveraging trackside infrastructure), building on lessons about challenges in marketing subsidized networks to suppliers.\n\n5. Evolving procurement processes\nThe Superfast procurement relied on framework contracts, while Project Gigabit is using larger area \"Lots\" and a rolling 3-year lookout for commercial plans to guide interventions.\n\nSo in essence, Project Gigabit takes the learning from challenges faced in the Superfast rural broadband rollout and applies it towards the more future-proof goal of nationwide gigabit connectivity, with a sharpened focus on the most economically challenging areas through new commercial models and procurement approaches.",

By 2022, this has changed with 7,500 properties having gigabit availability, and this being split evenly between commercial and non- commercial premises. However, over 80% of the properties that do not have access to gigabit broadband are in the non-commercial category. 35 | P a g e 3. Effects of Hubs on Broadband The Hub product aims to widen and improve broadband coverage in rural areas, alongside other policies targeting remote areas, such as recent voucher support. This chapter looks at the effects of the Hub on broadband. Its focus is whether nearby broadband effects occur and can be attributed to the Hub. To estimate the impact of the Hubs support, non-recipient areas who are as comparable as possible to the recipient areas \u2013 called the counterfactual \u2013 are explored seeing if the changes seen in the Hub areas differ. Any differences can be attributed to the Hub product in a causal sense, but ensuring the quality of the counterfactual is key. Challenges in identifying a comparison group of areas include untangling the effects of Hubs from other support and wider broadband investments or dealing with the possibility that Hubs have been delivered in all remote public buildings, exhausting the potential comparable areas. Key findings: \u25cf Hubs are positively affecting availability of gigabit. There are 14.3 more premises passed by gigabit capability in the year after the Hub investment in supported areas and this is 7 more than in comparable OAs with schools. Gigabit availability is rising quicker than comparable OAs in the year after support, with around half (51.3%) of the 64% rise in the premises additional in the supported areas. Around a third of the 9.3 rise in premises connected to ultrafast broadband in supported OAs is additional. \u25cf Postcode analysis finds broadband take up and performance improvements due to Hubs. Some part of the 28% improvement in speed of broadband in the postcodes that contain supported schools can be attributed to the Hub investment. The counterfactual postcodes include schools see broadband speed changes, but around 35.7% of the changes seen in Hub schools is not seen in these similar areas. \u25cf At output area level, take up changes are positive but not significantly different to comparable areas. The use of vouchers, the change in broadband speed and the number of fast connections increases in supported areas but not at rates different from the counterfactual areas.",

We have measured a consequential significant change in overall Fibre-To-The-Premise coverage in the first year since completion (2018/19). \u25cf The Trans Pennine Initiative (TPI) funded the placement of gigabit-capable fibre infrastructure along the existing rail route between Manchester and York, in partnership with Network Rail Telecoms. They have used this project to develop a commercial blueprint for use across the UK rail network, enabling suppliers to access trackside fibre to deliver connectivity in some of the remotest locations in the UK. Data within the report highlights that there has been an increase in network providers offering Fibre-To-The-Premise (FTTP) services along the TPI route. 13 This project was an early pathfinder for the GigaHub model, which brings together local public sector customers to create enough broadband demand to reduce the financial risk of building new full fibre networks. The solution is often a public sector network of sites that provide spine and backhaul fibre to a location. OFFICIAL 02/08/2021 Project Gigabit Delivery Plan Summer Update 26 Useful Information Market Reviews In each identified geography or \u2018Lot\u2019, BDUK conducts an Open Market Review to understand from suppliers if there is any current or planned investment over the next three years in broadband infrastructure (Next Generation Access broadband, ultrafast and gigabit-capable). We are in the process of implementing a rolling Open Market Review process, establishing a maintained national view of commercial build plans for the following three years. This will give a more comprehensive up-to-date view of commercial delivery and will avoid the need for having dedicated local Open Market Reviews. This is followed by a Public Review to validate the findings of the Open Market Review and BDUK\u2019s mapping to ensure it correctly represents the information provided by suppliers and to ensure that the right areas are targeted by Project Gigabit subsidy. BDUK invites stakeholders (including the public, businesses, internet service providers and broadband infrastructure operators) to provide us with feedback about the proposed eligible areas for government investment set out in each Public Review document. A list of public reviews can be found at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk- gigabit-programme-public-reviews.

This in turn had enabled children to learn remotely, video consultations to take place and council services to continue running without the need for face to face contact at a time when such contact had the potential to spread the virus. For some school stakeholders however, the Programme was only part of the solution and for some disadvantaged children access to IT equipment was the prohibitive factor in enabling remote learning.

Such infrastructure models could be supported by promoting access to 5G spectrum, through spectrum trading or potentially new spectrum sharing models. At the service level, enhanced mobile broadband services would be provided by MNOs and MVNOs, alongside new services enabled by existing and new players. 3.4.1 How we assessed these models 188. We have considered the potential models against a range of criteria \u2013 including the extent of 5G coverage, the pace of roll out, the costs, the incentives to improve quality and innovation over time, and how feasible it would be to implement the models.87 189. The Government recognises there is a debate about the optimal level of competitive intensity and consolidation in the UK mobile sector, and notes the number of recent mobile merger control cases across Europe, with a range of outcomes. The Government is clear that network competition between MNOs has been an important driver of mobile investment and expects that this will continue to be the case for 5G. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 59 190. As far as the Government is concerned, there is no magic number of mobile network operators. Each merger control case should be assessed on its merits at a particular time, by the relevant authorities. The European Commission, supported by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority, rejected a proposed merger of O2 and Three in 2016 because of pricing concerns resulting from a reduction in retail competition; concerns about the impact that a merger of MNOs in different network sharing arrangements would have on innovation and network roll out; and unease that there would be a reduction in wholesale competition with fewer potential hosts for MVNOs.88 191. There can be a tension between incentivising investment (with positive consumer benefits in the longer-term) and protecting consumers from the risk of higher retail prices in the short-term. Some argue that the increased cost efficiencies and increased scale from consolidation would enable greater investment and better consumer outcomes.89 At the same time, other analysis suggests there is no significant difference in industry-level investment between four and three player markets.90 Mobile investment should be closely monitored by Ofcom and appropriate options considered if it were to become clear that the current market structure was not supporting network investment in 5G at sustainable levels.",

At an OA level, the availability, which we define as the share of properties passed by the gigabit capable network, has increased faster than comparable areas so that more premises could be connected relatively cheaply and on a commercial basis. As the study is quite soon after the Hubs connection, the businesses and residences take-up of connection may be yet to occur. Awareness, drivers and uSse in homes and business near Hubs. Evidence suggests that whilst suppliers have used vouchers in areas around Hubs these do appear to have been delivered separately and not as a joint community solution, despite community initiatives being involved in connectivity projects beyond the Hubs: \u25cf Awareness of the Hub connection was low. Only a very small proportion say they use the Hub (2%, see p. 66) and that they understood the upgrade to the Hub enabled their own connection. Hubs were generally connected by the infrastructure provider Openreach, rather than suppliers, so awareness raising measures \u2013 such as marketing \u2013 may have been low. \u25cf A key motivation for many surveyed residents close to a Hub to be part of a BDUK Gigabit Voucher scheme is being part of a community initiative, rather than supplier marketing in non-Hub areas with this effect more pronounced the further they are from gigabit connectivity. \u25cf Use of the internet is similar for Hub and non-Hub voucher beneficiaries in households - most use is streaming, shopping, banking, and accessing healthcare online (80% to 92%). Those residents connecting to gigabit close to the Hub used their connection for working from home more (46% compared to 44%) and running a business from home more (27% compared to 23%). \u25cf Satisfaction amongst households and businesses with connection is very high. Approximately 90% gave a positive response for reliability and download speeds. Positivity amongst those connected near to a Hub was slightly lower, but much higher than previously increasing 20%- 40%. Those close to the Hub went on to report higher life satisfaction. Estimating the full impact with Vouchers. Households and businesses that have been connected recently using a government funded voucher were surveyed and were analysed comparing those near Hubs to those not near a Hub. The benefits of the connections near to Hubs are similar to those seen in connected properties distant from Hubs. However, near to Hub areas, voucher recruitment is more likely to result from community networks, rather than supplier marketing. Also, residents close to a Hub are less satisfied with their connection, compared to residents in the wider vouchers sample,",

Conclusions This chapter looks at the Hubs product, focusing on the Rural Gigabit Connectivity delivery that occurred from 2019-22. It highlights: \u25cf Hub investments until 2022. Delivered through the RGC Programme from May 2019 with completed builds up to March 2022, these have provided 1,021 connections in eligible public buildings, primarily schools and GP surgeries. \u25cf Selecting eligible buildings has focused on areas distant from the gigabit capable network. Public buildings were identified through ten projects led by partner bodies such as local authorities, DfE, devolved administrations, that have prioritised public buildings poorly served by broadband. This worked well by integrating wider plans of suppliers, managers of public buildings, and Openreach. \u25cf The connection is generally provided by Openreach. It is responsible for 791 of the 1,021 Hub connections. There are then some community-based or regional suppliers (such as Fibrus Networks in Northern Ireland). 34 | P a g e \u25cf Suppliers were attracted by the Hub product. It delivered fibre connectivity to rural and deep rural areas and provided a platform for further connections. But they felt that marketing of the Hub investments could be improved by contacting suppliers earlier. Also, the detail of the level of potential funding, timings for applications etc were unclear. \u25cf Delivery is linked to the wider provision of online services in a Hub. This can be managed through an aggregator (common for GP surgeries). Some Hubs experienced delays in delivery and noted information about progress was sometimes limited. \u25cf The logic model envisages spatial effects beyond the supported areas. The anticipated direct benefits are to the public services delivered in the Hubs enabling more digital technology in schools, surgeries etc. But then these connections bring the gigabit- capable network closer to hard-to-reach areas.

We will, however, continue to honour any vouchers already issued at that stage for providers to claim completed, eligible, gigabit connections. We have been working with suppliers to help judge projects that would meet the new eligibility criteria, and transition those projects that were submitted within a recent deadline. The majority of premises will retain their eligibility under the new voucher conditions, but to help individuals check, we will be launching a new eligibility checker. Where eligible, consumers will be able to contact registered suppliers to understand how vouchers could be used as part of a project to connect their community. Where not eligible, we will explain why and provide information so that consumers can identify what connectivity options are available to them and timelines for when we would reappraise eligibility if network build plans have changed or not progressed as expected. Providers will also be able to alert where they believe our eligibility assessment may be based on inaccurate records, just as they can today. It is also important that telecoms providers monitor when and where procurements are planned. We will pause the issue of new vouchers while we survey the market through the Public Review process and initiate procurements for target intervention areas. This is so bidders have a stable baseline through the process. Once a contract has been awarded, we will understand which premises are covered in immediate implementation plans and which will be part of a later phase. In the latter case, we are likely to make these areas eligible for 19/03/2021 Project Gigabit - Phase One Delivery Plan 22 OFFICIAL vouchers again for communities and providers that are seeking a connection sooner than otherwise planned. Public Sector Hubs The procurement of connectivity services in the public sector can help to drive the availability of gigabit infrastructure and services into the hardest to reach parts of the UK. We have successfully helped procure a number of Public Sector Hubs in remote areas. We have set up a Dynamic Purchasing System (RM6095) with Crown Commercial Services for Gigabit-Capable Connectivity and now have 41 suppliers fully registered. Local authorities and devolved administrations are procuring services from the DPS, working with the supplier market to reduce barriers for the commercial sector to deliver gigabit services to the hardest to reach areas. We expect many other government departments and authorities to participate in regional procurements, with 100-200+ hubs sites expected in each regional procurement.",

        "response": "The sources provided do not go into extensive detail comparing the impacts of different procurement models (regional vs local suppliers) on the speed and effectiveness of rural broadband infrastructure delivery. However, there are a few relevant points that can be gathered:\n\n1. For the Superfast Broadband Programme, most local bodies utilized a centralized procurement framework set up by BDUK to select a single national supplier - BT/Openreach (Section 2.2.1). This was seen as an appropriate model by local bodies.\n\n2. However, some local bodies highlighted that developing and maintaining strong relationships with potential suppliers, beyond just the centralized framework, helped ensure good responses to tenders issued (Section 7.1.4).\n\n3. For the newer Rural Gigabit Connectivity Hubs program under Project Gigabit, Openreach provided 791 out of 1,021 hub connections, but there were also some regional/community suppliers like Fibrus Networks in Northern Ireland (Page 34).\n\n4. Suppliers felt the marketing of the Hubs investments could be improved by contacting them earlier in the process and providing clearer details on funding levels and timelines (Page 34).\n\nSo while a centralized national procurement framework was utilized for the Superfast programme, the importance of local supplier engagement is highlighted. And for the newer gigabit interventions, there seems to be a mix of both national (Openreach) and regional suppliers delivering connections, with suggestions that earlier supplier involvement could be beneficial.\n\nHowever, the sources do not provide a direct comparison of how regional vs national supplier models specifically impacted the speed and effectiveness of rural delivery. The focus is more on describing the different approaches rather than evaluating their relative performance outcomes. More specific evidence on comparative impacts would be needed to substantively answer this question.",

Conclusions This chapter looks at the Hubs product, focusing on the Rural Gigabit Connectivity delivery that occurred from 2019-22. It highlights: \u25cf Hub investments until 2022. Delivered through the RGC Programme from May 2019 with completed builds up to March 2022, these have provided 1,021 connections in eligible public buildings, primarily schools and GP surgeries. \u25cf Selecting eligible buildings has focused on areas distant from the gigabit capable network. Public buildings were identified through ten projects led by partner bodies such as local authorities, DfE, devolved administrations, that have prioritised public buildings poorly served by broadband. This worked well by integrating wider plans of suppliers, managers of public buildings, and Openreach. \u25cf The connection is generally provided by Openreach. It is responsible for 791 of the 1,021 Hub connections. There are then some community-based or regional suppliers (such as Fibrus Networks in Northern Ireland). 34 | P a g e \u25cf Suppliers were attracted by the Hub product. It delivered fibre connectivity to rural and deep rural areas and provided a platform for further connections. But they felt that marketing of the Hub investments could be improved by contacting suppliers earlier. Also, the detail of the level of potential funding, timings for applications etc were unclear. \u25cf Delivery is linked to the wider provision of online services in a Hub. This can be managed through an aggregator (common for GP surgeries). Some Hubs experienced delays in delivery and noted information about progress was sometimes limited. \u25cf The logic model envisages spatial effects beyond the supported areas. The anticipated direct benefits are to the public services delivered in the Hubs enabling more digital technology in schools, surgeries etc. But then these connections bring the gigabit- capable network closer to hard-to-reach areas. Suppliers are more likely to be able to meet local residential and business demand for fast broadband. \u25cf Areas supported have low broadband performance and coverage. In 2020, 11.9% of premises in the supported areas have gigabit available, less than half the 27.7% seen in the UK. Download speeds are 42,6 Mbps compared to 72.5 in the wider UK. \u25cf Provision of gigabit capable connections is unlikely on a commercial basis.

Such infrastructure models could be supported by promoting access to 5G spectrum, through spectrum trading or potentially new spectrum sharing models. At the service level, enhanced mobile broadband services would be provided by MNOs and MVNOs, alongside new services enabled by existing and new players. 3.4.1 How we assessed these models 188. We have considered the potential models against a range of criteria \u2013 including the extent of 5G coverage, the pace of roll out, the costs, the incentives to improve quality and innovation over time, and how feasible it would be to implement the models.87 189. The Government recognises there is a debate about the optimal level of competitive intensity and consolidation in the UK mobile sector, and notes the number of recent mobile merger control cases across Europe, with a range of outcomes. The Government is clear that network competition between MNOs has been an important driver of mobile investment and expects that this will continue to be the case for 5G. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 59 190. As far as the Government is concerned, there is no magic number of mobile network operators. Each merger control case should be assessed on its merits at a particular time, by the relevant authorities. The European Commission, supported by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority, rejected a proposed merger of O2 and Three in 2016 because of pricing concerns resulting from a reduction in retail competition; concerns about the impact that a merger of MNOs in different network sharing arrangements would have on innovation and network roll out; and unease that there would be a reduction in wholesale competition with fewer potential hosts for MVNOs.88 191. There can be a tension between incentivising investment (with positive consumer benefits in the longer-term) and protecting consumers from the risk of higher retail prices in the short-term. Some argue that the increased cost efficiencies and increased scale from consolidation would enable greater investment and better consumer outcomes.89 At the same time, other analysis suggests there is no significant difference in industry-level investment between four and three player markets.90 Mobile investment should be closely monitored by Ofcom and appropriate options considered if it were to become clear that the current market structure was not supporting network investment in 5G at sustainable levels.",

They were then more likely to have not considered an upgrade to their connection in the past because it was not available to them, with 81% citing this reason while the rate was 71% in commercial areas. In the non-commercial areas, respondents also reported a higher level of satisfaction with their pre-connection broadband, Generally, people\u2019s awareness of the connection being connected to the Hub investments into nearby public buildings was low (at 9%). However, this knowledge was more common in the remote, non-commercial properties at 12%, being 6% in the commercial areas The marketing of vouchers to residential broadband users is primarily through suppliers, who would then provide the connection and draw the voucher funding. When asked about how beneficiaries heard about the voucher scheme, generally the response that this was from the supplier was high. However, in remote areas in terms of the modelled cost of connecting residences, the households close to a Hub reported hearing about the voucher support through the community over half the time. They were also relatively unaware of the possibility of having a fast connection, assuming they were too remote. The survey also reveals a marginally higher knowledge of the Hub investment in this subsample. Conclusions This chapter presents the results of a survey of residential and business voucher beneficiaries where the connection was near (within a 5km radius) to a Hub. The analysis uses a set of questions that were asked recently in a large survey conducted to evaluate vouchers more generally, and results from that survey provides the potential effect of the Hubs in terms of a comparator. \u25cf Residential survey had 1,518 respondents with 33 follow-up interviews. Residents that live close to a Hub are similar in profile to residents in the comparison sample in terms of age, employment status, household size and income. There were some statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding household type, housing tenure, and occupation. The comparator survey had 1,356 respondents. \u25cf Use of internet similar to non-Hub voucher beneficiaries. The comparison group and the Hubs sample are making greater use of the internet for personal, education and professional purposes. Some small statistically significant differences were found in the data \u2013 a slightly lower proportion of residents in the Hubs sample are making greater use of streaming entertainment services and keeping in touch with family and friends. \u25cf There are community-level networks. Residents close to a Hub were more likely to have heard about the voucher through a local community initiative, and it was less likely to be through a broadband supplier, compared to residents in the voucher sample.

For some school stakeholders however, the Programme was only part of the solution and for some disadvantaged children access to IT equipment was the prohibitive factor in enabling remote learning.

        "response": "Based on the information provided in the sources, passive infrastructure sharing, such as access to existing ducts and poles, plays an important enabling role in the UK's plan for nationwide full fibre deployment. However, the sources do not go into extensive detail on how this specifically relates to regulatory goals.\n\nA few key points about passive infrastructure sharing from the sources:\n\n1. The Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review (referenced on page 59) highlights that infrastructure models promoting access to existing infrastructure like ducts and poles could help support the 5G rollout and provision of enhanced mobile broadband services.\n\n2. Ofcom has previously reported (referenced on page 16) that opening up BT's ducts and poles to rival providers has the potential to bring significant benefits by reducing the cost of building new fiber networks.\n\n3. Several of the commercial broadband providers receiving major investments mentioned (e.g. CityFibre, Gigaclear, Hyperoptic) are pursuing fiber deployment models that leverage existing infrastructure like sewers, ducts and poles belonging to other utilities.\n\nSo passive infrastructure sharing and access to third-party infrastructure is viewed as a way to reduce deployment costs and facilitate accelerated full fibre rollout by commercial operators. This aligns with the government's goals for gigabit-capable nationwide coverage.\n\nHowever, the sources do not explicitly link passive infrastructure sharing to specific regulatory goals or policies around it. There are no details provided on Ofcom's regulatory approach, requirements or access pricing for enabling infrastructure sharing between operators. While it is clearly an enabling factor, the sources are light on the details of how infrastructure sharing precisely ties into the regulatory framework and incentives around full fibre. More insight into the regulatory mechanisms would be needed to fully answer this part of the question.",

We have measured a consequential significant change in overall Fibre-To-The-Premise coverage in the first year since completion (2018/19). \u25cf The Trans Pennine Initiative (TPI) funded the placement of gigabit-capable fibre infrastructure along the existing rail route between Manchester and York, in partnership with Network Rail Telecoms. They have used this project to develop a commercial blueprint for use across the UK rail network, enabling suppliers to access trackside fibre to deliver connectivity in some of the remotest locations in the UK. Data within the report highlights that there has been an increase in network providers offering Fibre-To-The-Premise (FTTP) services along the TPI route. 13 This project was an early pathfinder for the GigaHub model, which brings together local public sector customers to create enough broadband demand to reduce the financial risk of building new full fibre networks.

We are in the process of implementing a rolling Open Market Review process, establishing a maintained national view of commercial build plans for the following three years. This will give a more comprehensive up-to-date view of commercial delivery and will avoid the need for having dedicated local Open Market Reviews. This is followed by a Public Review to validate the findings of the Open Market Review and BDUK\u2019s mapping to ensure it correctly represents the information provided by suppliers and to ensure that the right areas are targeted by Project Gigabit subsidy. BDUK invites stakeholders (including the public, businesses, internet service providers and broadband infrastructure operators) to provide us with feedback about the proposed eligible areas for government investment set out in each Public Review document.

Superfast availability rose from 22 percent of premises in 2016 to just over 60 percent on postcodes that benefitted from subsidised upgrades by September 2019. Superfast availability rose in postcodes in the matched comparison group at a slower rate (from 25 percent to just over 45 percent). Most of this apparent impact on broadband availability occurred in the 2019 which aligns with the delivery profile of Phase 3 contracts (see figure below). Figure 4.2: Evolution of superfast availability, postcodes receiving subsidised coverage by September 2019 and matched group of eligible postcodes, Phase 3 Source: Connected Nations, Ofcom, Ipsos MORI analysis The statistical analyses provided estimates of the increase in share of premises benefitting from NGA, superfast and FTTP availability between 2016 and 2019 that could be attributed to the delivery of Phase 3 contracts. These estimates were applied to the number of premises on the postcodes benefitting from the Programme to reach an estimate of the number of additional premises receiving subsidised coverage by September 2019. These results are summarised in the table below: On postcodes benefitting from subsidised coverage by September 2019, Phase 3 contracts were estimated to have increased the number of premises: \u25aa Passed by NGA coverage by 2,300 to 16,600 (with the weight of results towards the lower end of this range). \u25aa With superfast coverage (30Mbps) by 10,800 to 29,300. \u25aa With FTTP coverage by 19,000 to 30,300. 21 Available at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/superfast-broadband-programme-state-aid-evaluation-report-2020 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Avergae % of premises with superfast (30Mbit/s) coverage Postcodes benefitting from subsidised coverage by September 2019 Comparison postcodes eligible for investment sharing equivalent characteristics Ipsos MORI | 18-101398-01 Evaluation of the Superfast Broadband Programme \u2013 Process evaluation report 51 18-101398-01 | FINAL VERSION | | Internal Use Only | This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for Market Research, ISO 20252, and with the Ipsos MORI Terms and Conditions which can be found at http://www.ipsos-mori.com/terms. \u00a9",

These broad questions were further refined as part of an initial planning stage that was completed in May 2019, which involved the agreement of bespoke evaluation questions for each of the projects and evaluation approach. This report builds on a baseline, process and early impacts assessment that was completed in July 2019 and the interim evaluations which took place in 2020-2022. This",
