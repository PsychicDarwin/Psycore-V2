        "response": "The provided text highlights the following evolution from the Superfast Broadband Programme to Project Gigabit:\n\n1. **Focus Shift:**  Superfast aimed for 30Mbps speeds, while Project Gigabit targets nationwide gigabit-capable broadband coverage as quickly as possible.  The text emphasizes a desire to move beyond 85% coverage and \"push towards 100% nationwide coverage.\"\n\n2. **Funding and Approach:**  Project Gigabit involves up to \u00a35 billion in funding for the hardest-to-reach areas, utilizing a \"package of coordinated and mutually supportive interventions.\"  This suggests a more comprehensive and targeted approach compared to the previous program.  The text mentions an additional \u00a390 million specifically to extend existing Superfast contracts to deliver gigabit access in hard-to-reach areas, indicating a building upon previous infrastructure.\n\n3. **Data Collection and Planning:**  Project Gigabit incorporates Open Market Reviews (OMR) to understand existing and planned commercial investments.  The government is actively gathering data from telecom providers to create a comprehensive picture of gigabit coverage. This implies a data-driven approach to identify areas lacking commercial interest and requiring government intervention.\n\n4. **Collaboration:** The government is working with devolved administrations to ensure a coordinated approach across the UK, aligning with existing Superfast contracts in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. This suggests a greater emphasis on national consistency and leveraging existing infrastructure investments.\n\n5. **Addressing Overbuilding:**  The text acknowledges the issue of network overbuilding (where an existing gigabit network is built over by another), generally viewing it as beneficial for consumers.  While not a direct lesson learned, it reflects a consideration of potential duplication of efforts within the new program.\n\n\nWhile the text doesn't explicitly state \"lessons learned,\" the shift in focus, funding approach, data collection, and collaboration suggests a more strategic, targeted, and data-driven approach in Project Gigabit, building on the foundation laid by the Superfast Broadband Programme.",

By enabling alternative network operators to use this existing infrastructure, the strategy aims to minimize deployment costs, encourage market entry and expansion, foster competition, and maximize commercial rollout.\n\nThis is directly linked to the regulatory goal of nationwide full fibre coverage.  Regulators facilitate fibre deployment, making it more attractive for alternative operators, particularly in commercially challenging areas. This, in turn, reduces the need for public subsidy.  The \"outside-in\" strategy, which prioritizes the hardest-to-reach areas, is supported by passive infrastructure sharing, making deployment feasible in these less commercially viable locations.
