        "response": "The classification of premises as White, Grey, Black, or Under Review in the context of broadband deployment typically relates to the availability of broadband services and the eligibility for government subsidies. While the specific details of the Norfolk Public Review are not provided in the document you shared, I can explain the general classification system used by BDUK (Building Digital UK) and its implications:\n\n1. **White Areas**: These are areas where no broadband infrastructure currently exists or is planned in the near future. Premises in White areas are typically eligible for government subsidies because they lack adequate broadband service.\n\n2. **Grey Areas**: These areas have broadband infrastructure provided by a single supplier. Since there is some level of service, these areas may have limited eligibility for subsidies, depending on the specific goals and criteria of the subsidy program.\n\n3. **Black Areas**: These areas have broadband infrastructure provided by two or more suppliers. As these areas are considered to have competitive broadband services, they are generally not eligible for government subsidies.\n\n4. **Under Review**: This classification is used for areas where the broadband status is uncertain or where there are plans for future infrastructure development that need to be confirmed. These areas might be temporarily ineligible for subsidies until their status is clarified.\n\nThe implications of these classifications are significant for determining which areas can receive government funding to improve broadband infrastructure. White areas are prioritized for subsidies to ensure that underserved regions receive the necessary support to achieve better connectivity.",

The average cost per premises contracted to be upgraded by Phase is presented in the figure below. This shows that the average cost per premises upgraded has increased by Phase. This is not surprising as the projects maximised the number of premises upgraded, therefore easier / cheaper premises were upgraded first. Additionally, in Phase 3, there was more of a focus on the more expensive FTTP connections (rather than FTTC), which may also contribute to the increase in unit cost. Figure 2.2: Cost per premise upgraded and funding source7 Source: Cora Management Information, June 2020 There are significant differences between the cost per contracted premises by provider and Phase (see the table below). In Phase 1, the cost per premises for BT / OpenReach was relatively low (\u00a3366), but the unit cost to BT / OpenReach increased through the Phases to \u00a31,703 in Phase 3. Similarly, the cost per premises delivered was high for Gigaclear in Phases 2 and 3 (approximately \u00a31,555 to \u00a31,749). The costs to Airband are also relatively high.

It was reported that the alternative approaches to tendering were more resource intensive than the recommended approach. Therefore, it is recommended that Local Bodies follow the approach recommended by BDUK, and that lotting of contracts is utilised where possible, to improve cost effectiveness. Building strong relationships with providers was seen as important to ensuring a good number of responses to tenders issued. 7.1.4 Project delivery and management \u25aa Most Local Bodies had utilised similar project management approaches, with day to day project managers overseen by steering groups / committees and where required support was provided by BDUK. This was described as an appropriate model to manage the contracts by the Local Bodies. A small number of projects described working with the Programme beneficiary as being partnership rather than a client-contractor relationship. These bodies felt they got more out of the provider on the delivery of the project with barriers addressed through close partnership working. This again reinforces that Local Bodies should work hard to develop and maintain relationships with providers. \u25aa The delivery of Phase 3 contracts has been delayed, with roll out behind where providers anticipated it would be. Some of the reasons for this were highlighted as being the capacity of Programme beneficiaries to deliver their contracts, the duration of time required to resolve change requests and the enforcement of milestone zero within contracts. BDUK has been working to develop new approaches to ensure change requests are resolved in a timely manner and this should help to resolve this issue, but Local Bodies also need to ensure that their processes allow for a rapid response to change requests and escalate significant change requests to BDUK expediently. 7.2 Programme outcomes 7.2.1 Market outcomes The key findings from the market analysis undertaken are: \u25aa Phase 3 contracts increased the number of premises passed by Next Generation Access (NGA) services by 2,300 to 16,600 on postcodes benefitting from subsidised coverage by the end of September 2019 (with the weight of evidence to the lower end of this range). The share of the 79,100 premises upgraded by the end of September 2019 that would not have otherwise benefitted from NGA coverage is estimated at between 3 and 21 percent.

There are very few studies that have sought to examine the cost-effectiveness of broadband Programmes in the EU after delivery had been completed. This may in part be because of a relative lack of public Programmes on the same scale as the Superfast Programme and a consequent lack of published evaluative work. However, there are some examples where the expected unit cost of premises passed has been estimated. It should be noted that these are projected public sector costs per gross premises passed, rather than observed costs. The estimated costs are: 27, 28 \u25aa In Austria, the cost per premises",

Building Digital UK 2023 42 Ipsos | Evaluation of the Local Full Fibre Network wave one projects: Trans Pennine Initiative 6 Conclusions The key findings from the Trans Pennine Initiative evaluation are: \u25aa The physical works were completed in December 2019, with a core fibre optical cable installed and operational between Manchester and York, and connected to two internet exchanges. Nine Fibre Interface Points have been installed along the route, with a further three in development. Network Rail or a third party partner have the opportunity to install further Fibre Interface Points along the route if there is a commercially viable reason for doing so. \u25aa Marketing and promotion of the Trans Pennine Initiative product proved challenging for Network Rail, due to the price constraints and the launch of a new Openreach dark fibre product around the same time as their marketing activity. The project was able to generate 74 potential customers, but of these only five were converted into sales. This shows that there are significant challenges to marketing the trackside fibre in this way. \u25aa As a result of the lessons learned from the Trans Pennine Initiative project, Network Rail have altered their commercial approach to trackside fibre. The lessons learned were around the need to have telecommunications specialists involved to sell access to dark fibre products, as the Trans Pennine Initiative struggled to gain traction in this area. In 2021, they launched Project Reach, which offers a commercial provider access to trackside fibre, in exchange for the capital investment to construct the trackside fibre network. \u25aa Deployment of gigabit-capable networks within 1km of the Trans Pennine Initiative route has increased between 2017 and 2022. The econometric analysis undertaken, comparing connectivity outcomes along the Trans Pennine Initiative route and the Reading to Bristol rail route indicates that the project has had a positive impact on gigabit-capable coverage and take-up of ultrafast broadband connections. This is despite there being a limited number of network providers actually using the Trans Pennine Initiative network to provide broadband services. The table",

        "response": "The UK government's strategy for broadband has evolved significantly from the Superfast Broadband Programme to Project Gigabit, reflecting changes in technology, market conditions, and policy priorities. Here are the key aspects of this evolution and the lessons incorporated into the newer interventions:\n\n1. **Focus on Gigabit-Capable Broadband**: \n   - The Superfast Broadband Programme primarily aimed to provide superfast broadband (speeds of at least 30 Mbps) to a large number of premises. In contrast, Project Gigabit focuses on delivering gigabit-capable broadband, which offers much higher speeds (up to 1,000 Mbps or more), reflecting the increasing demand for faster internet connections.\n\n2. **Technological Advancements**:\n   - The shift from superfast to gigabit-capable broadband involves a greater emphasis on deploying Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) technology, which provides more reliable and faster internet connections compared to the Fibre to the Cabinet (FTTC) technology used in many superfast deployments.\n\n3. **Geographical Targeting**:\n   - Project Gigabit places a stronger emphasis on reaching rural and hard-to-reach areas that were not fully addressed by the Superfast Broadband Programme. This is achieved through targeted subsidies and interventions to ensure these areas are not left behind in the digital transformation.\n\n4. **Market Engagement and Open Market Reviews**:\n   - The government has refined its approach to market engagement by conducting Open Market Reviews and Public Reviews to better understand existing and planned broadband infrastructure investments. This helps in accurately identifying areas that require government intervention and ensures that public funds are used effectively.\n\n5. **Partnerships and Procurement Models**:\n   - Lessons from the Superfast Broadband Programme highlighted the importance of strong partnerships between local bodies and central government, as well as the need for effective procurement models. Project Gigabit incorporates these lessons by fostering collaboration and using competitive tendering processes to select suppliers.\n\n6. **Clawback Mechanisms and Cost Management**:\n   - The use of clawback mechanisms in the Superfast Broadband Programme, which allowed for the recovery of funds if take-up exceeded expectations, has informed cost management strategies in Project Gigabit. This ensures that public investments are safeguarded and can be reinvested in further broadband expansion.\n\n7. **Learning from Pilot Projects**:\n   - Initiatives like the Trans Pennine Initiative and the GigaHub model have provided valuable insights into deploying gigabit-capable infrastructure in challenging environments. These pilot projects have informed the broader rollout strategy of Project Gigabit.\n\nOverall, Project Gigabit builds on the successes and lessons of the Superfast Broadband Programme by aiming for higher-speed connections, focusing on underserved areas, and employing more sophisticated planning and procurement strategies to achieve the UK government's digital connectivity goals.",

By 2022, this has changed with 7,500 properties having gigabit availability, and this being split evenly between commercial and non- commercial premises. However, over 80% of the properties that do not have access to gigabit broadband are in the non-commercial category. 35 | P a g e 3. Effects of Hubs on Broadband The Hub product aims to widen and improve broadband coverage in rural areas, alongside other policies targeting remote areas, such as recent voucher support. This chapter looks at the effects of the Hub on broadband. Its focus is whether nearby broadband effects occur and can be attributed to the Hub. To estimate the impact of the Hubs support, non-recipient areas who are as comparable as possible to the recipient areas \u2013 called the counterfactual \u2013 are explored seeing if the changes seen in the Hub areas differ. Any differences can be attributed to the Hub product in a causal sense, but ensuring the quality of the counterfactual is key. Challenges in identifying a comparison group of areas include untangling the effects of Hubs from other support and wider broadband investments or dealing with the possibility that Hubs have been delivered in all remote public buildings, exhausting the potential comparable areas. Key findings: \u25cf Hubs are positively affecting availability of gigabit. There are 14.3 more premises passed by gigabit capability in the year after the Hub investment in supported areas and this is 7 more than in comparable OAs with schools. Gigabit availability is rising quicker than comparable OAs in the year after support, with around half (51.3%) of the 64% rise in the premises additional in the supported areas. Around a third of the 9.3 rise in premises connected to ultrafast broadband in supported OAs is additional. \u25cf Postcode analysis finds broadband take up and performance improvements due to Hubs. Some part of the 28% improvement in speed of broadband in the postcodes that contain supported schools can be attributed to the Hub investment. The counterfactual postcodes include schools see broadband speed changes, but around 35.7% of the changes seen in Hub schools is not seen in these similar areas. \u25cf At output area level, take up changes are positive but not significantly different to comparable areas. The use of vouchers, the change in broadband speed and the number of fast connections increases in supported areas but not at rates different from the counterfactual areas.",

We have measured a consequential significant change in overall Fibre-To-The-Premise coverage in the first year since completion (2018/19). \u25cf The Trans Pennine Initiative (TPI) funded the placement of gigabit-capable fibre infrastructure along the existing rail route between Manchester and York, in partnership with Network Rail Telecoms. They have used this project to develop a commercial blueprint for use across the UK rail network, enabling suppliers to access trackside fibre to deliver connectivity in some of the remotest locations in the UK. Data within the report highlights that there has been an increase in network providers offering Fibre-To-The-Premise (FTTP) services along the TPI route. 13 This project was an early pathfinder for the GigaHub model, which brings together local public sector customers to create enough broadband demand to reduce the financial risk of building new full fibre networks. The solution is often a public sector network of sites that provide spine and backhaul fibre to a location. OFFICIAL 02/08/2021 Project Gigabit Delivery Plan Summer Update 26 Useful Information Market Reviews In each identified geography or \u2018Lot\u2019, BDUK conducts an Open Market Review to understand from suppliers if there is any current or planned investment over the next three years in broadband infrastructure (Next Generation Access broadband, ultrafast and gigabit-capable). We are in the process of implementing a rolling Open Market Review process, establishing a maintained national view of commercial build plans for the following three years. This will give a more comprehensive up-to-date view of commercial delivery and will avoid the need for having dedicated local Open Market Reviews. This is followed by a Public Review to validate the findings of the Open Market Review and BDUK\u2019s mapping to ensure it correctly represents the information provided by suppliers and to ensure that the right areas are targeted by Project Gigabit subsidy. BDUK invites stakeholders (including the public, businesses, internet service providers and broadband infrastructure operators) to provide us with feedback about the proposed eligible areas for government investment set out in each Public Review document. A list of public reviews can be found at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk- gigabit-programme-public-reviews.

        "response": "The early process evaluation of the Gigabit Infrastructure Subsidy intervention identified several key limitations encountered during the Open Market Review (OMR) and Public Review processes. These limitations, categorized as challenges, include:\n\n1. **Data Accuracy and Completeness**:\n   - Both the OMR and Public Review processes faced challenges related to ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data. Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to misidentification of areas that require intervention.\n\n2. **Supplier Engagement**:\n   - Engaging with suppliers to gather comprehensive data was a challenge. Some suppliers may have been reluctant to share detailed future plans due to commercial sensitivities, affecting the quality of the data collected.\n\n3. **Dynamic Market Conditions**:\n   - The broadband market is dynamic, with rapid changes in infrastructure deployment plans. This made it difficult to maintain an up-to-date view of the market, impacting the reliability of the OMR and Public Review findings.\n\n4. **Complexity in Mapping and Analysis**:\n   - Mapping broadband coverage and analyzing the data to identify eligible areas for subsidy was complex, requiring sophisticated tools and expertise.\n\n5. **Stakeholder Feedback**:\n   - Gathering and incorporating feedback from a diverse range of stakeholders, including the public, businesses, and local authorities, was resource-intensive and could lead to conflicting inputs.\n\n6. **Regulatory and Policy Constraints**:\n   - Navigating regulatory and policy constraints limited the flexibility of the OMR and Public Review processes, potentially affecting the speed and effectiveness of the intervention.\n\n7. **Coordination with Other Initiatives**:\n   - Ensuring coordination with other broadband initiatives and avoiding overlap or duplication of efforts was challenging, particularly in areas with multiple ongoing projects.\n\nThese challenges highlight the complexities involved in conducting OMR and Public Review processes and underscore the importance of robust planning, stakeholder engagement, and data management to address these challenges effectively.",

This in turn had enabled children to learn remotely, video consultations to take place and council services to continue running without the need for face to face contact at a time when such contact had the potential to spread the virus. For some school stakeholders however, the Programme was only part of the solution and for some disadvantaged children access to IT equipment was the prohibitive factor in enabling remote learning.

Such infrastructure models could be supported by promoting access to 5G spectrum, through spectrum trading or potentially new spectrum sharing models. At the service level, enhanced mobile broadband services would be provided by MNOs and MVNOs, alongside new services enabled by existing and new players. 3.4.1 How we assessed these models 188. We have considered the potential models against a range of criteria \u2013 including the extent of 5G coverage, the pace of roll out, the costs, the incentives to improve quality and innovation over time, and how feasible it would be to implement the models.87 189. The Government recognises there is a debate about the optimal level of competitive intensity and consolidation in the UK mobile sector, and notes the number of recent mobile merger control cases across Europe, with a range of outcomes. The Government is clear that network competition between MNOs has been an important driver of mobile investment and expects that this will continue to be the case for 5G. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 59 190. As far as the Government is concerned, there is no magic number of mobile network operators. Each merger control case should be assessed on its merits at a particular time, by the relevant authorities. The European Commission, supported by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority, rejected a proposed merger of O2 and Three in 2016 because of pricing concerns resulting from a reduction in retail competition; concerns about the impact that a merger of MNOs in different network sharing arrangements would have on innovation and network roll out; and unease that there would be a reduction in wholesale competition with fewer potential hosts for MVNOs.88 191. There can be a tension between incentivising investment (with positive consumer benefits in the longer-term) and protecting consumers from the risk of higher retail prices in the short-term. Some argue that the increased cost efficiencies and increased scale from consolidation would enable greater investment and better consumer outcomes.89 At the same time, other analysis suggests there is no significant difference in industry-level investment between four and three player markets.90 Mobile investment should be closely monitored by Ofcom and appropriate options considered if it were to become clear that the current market structure was not supporting network investment in 5G at sustainable levels.",

At an OA level, the availability, which we define as the share of properties passed by the gigabit capable network, has increased faster than comparable areas so that more premises could be connected relatively cheaply and on a commercial basis. As the study is quite soon after the Hubs connection, the businesses and residences take-up of connection may be yet to occur. Awareness, drivers and uSse in homes and business near Hubs. Evidence suggests that whilst suppliers have used vouchers in areas around Hubs these do appear to have been delivered separately and not as a joint community solution, despite community initiatives being involved in connectivity projects beyond the Hubs: \u25cf Awareness of the Hub connection was low. Only a very small proportion say they use the Hub (2%, see p. 66) and that they understood the upgrade to the Hub enabled their own connection. Hubs were generally connected by the infrastructure provider Openreach, rather than suppliers, so awareness raising measures \u2013 such as marketing \u2013 may have been low. \u25cf A key motivation for many surveyed residents close to a Hub to be part of a BDUK Gigabit Voucher scheme is being part of a community initiative, rather than supplier marketing in non-Hub areas with this effect more pronounced the further they are from gigabit connectivity. \u25cf Use of the internet is similar for Hub and non-Hub voucher beneficiaries in households - most use is streaming, shopping, banking, and accessing healthcare online (80% to 92%). Those residents connecting to gigabit close to the Hub used their connection for working from home more (46% compared to 44%) and running a business from home more (27% compared to 23%). \u25cf Satisfaction amongst households and businesses with connection is very high. Approximately 90% gave a positive response for reliability and download speeds. Positivity amongst those connected near to a Hub was slightly lower, but much higher than previously increasing 20%- 40%. Those close to the Hub went on to report higher life satisfaction. Estimating the full impact with Vouchers. Households and businesses that have been connected recently using a government funded voucher were surveyed and were analysed comparing those near Hubs to those not near a Hub. The benefits of the connections near to Hubs are similar to those seen in connected properties distant from Hubs. However, near to Hub areas, voucher recruitment is more likely to result from community networks, rather than supplier marketing. Also, residents close to a Hub are less satisfied with their connection, compared to residents in the wider vouchers sample,",

We will, however, continue to honour any vouchers already issued at that stage for providers to claim completed, eligible, gigabit connections. We have been working with suppliers to help judge projects that would meet the new eligibility criteria, and transition those projects that were submitted within a recent deadline. The majority of premises will retain their eligibility under the new voucher conditions, but to help individuals check, we will be launching a new eligibility checker. Where eligible, consumers will be able to contact registered suppliers to understand how vouchers could be used as part of a project to connect their community. Where not eligible, we will explain why and provide information so that consumers can identify what connectivity options are available to them and timelines for when we would reappraise eligibility if network build plans have changed or not progressed as expected. Providers will also be able to alert where they believe our eligibility assessment may be based on inaccurate records, just as they can today. It is also important that telecoms providers monitor when and where procurements are planned. We will pause the issue of new vouchers while we survey the market through the Public Review process and initiate procurements for target intervention areas. This is so bidders have a stable baseline through the process. Once a contract has been awarded, we will understand which premises are covered in immediate implementation plans and which will be part of a later phase. In the latter case, we are likely to make these areas eligible for 19/03/2021 Project Gigabit - Phase One Delivery Plan 22 OFFICIAL vouchers again for communities and providers that are seeking a connection sooner than otherwise planned. Public Sector Hubs The procurement of connectivity services in the public sector can help to drive the availability of gigabit infrastructure and services into the hardest to reach parts of the UK. We have successfully helped procure a number of Public Sector Hubs in remote areas. We have set up a Dynamic Purchasing System (RM6095) with Crown Commercial Services for Gigabit-Capable Connectivity and now have 41 suppliers fully registered. Local authorities and devolved administrations are procuring services from the DPS, working with the supplier market to reduce barriers for the commercial sector to deliver gigabit services to the hardest to reach areas. We expect many other government departments and authorities to participate in regional procurements, with 100-200+ hubs sites expected in each regional procurement.",

    "How have different procurement models (e.g., regional vs. local suppliers) impacted the speed and effectiveness of broadband infrastructure delivery in rural areas?": {
        "response": "The impact of different procurement models, such as regional versus local suppliers, on the speed and effectiveness of broadband infrastructure delivery in rural areas can be understood through the various concepts associated with these entities. Here's how these models have influenced broadband delivery:\n\n1. **Regional Suppliers**:\n   - **Scale and Resources**: Regional suppliers are often associated with having greater resources and the ability to handle large-scale projects. This can lead to faster deployment of broadband infrastructure as they can leverage economies of scale and have access to a larger workforce.\n   - **Standardization**: They may offer standardized solutions that can be quickly implemented across multiple areas, potentially speeding up the deployment process.\n   - **Coordination**: Regional suppliers might face challenges in coordinating with local stakeholders, which can sometimes slow down the process if local needs and conditions are not adequately considered.\n   - **Influence on Rural Areas**: The influence of regional suppliers on rural areas can be significant due to their ability to bring in substantial investment and technology, covering larger areas more efficiently.\n\n2. **Local Suppliers**:\n   - **Local Knowledge**: Local suppliers are associated with having a better understanding of the specific geographical and community needs, which can lead to more tailored solutions that effectively address local challenges.\n   - **Community Engagement**: They may be more effective in engaging with the community and local authorities, facilitating smoother project implementation and higher acceptance.\n   - **Resource Limitations**: Local suppliers might have limited resources compared to larger regional suppliers, which can impact the speed of deployment. They may also face challenges in scaling up operations for larger projects.\n   - **Influence on Rural Areas**: Local suppliers can have a positive influence on rural areas by ensuring that solutions are tailored to the specific needs of the community, although their impact might be limited by resource constraints.\n\n3. **Hybrid Models**:\n   - **Combines Regional and Local Suppliers**: Hybrid models that combine the strengths of both regional and local suppliers can enhance the speed and effectiveness of broadband delivery. Regional suppliers can provide the necessary investment and technology, while local suppliers can ensure that solutions are tailored to the specific needs of the community.\n\nOverall, the choice between regional and local suppliers should consider the specific context of the rural area, including the existing infrastructure, community needs, and the scale of the project. A well-coordinated approach that leverages the strengths of both regional and local suppliers can enhance the speed and effectiveness of broadband infrastructure delivery in rural areas.",

Such infrastructure models could be supported by promoting access to 5G spectrum, through spectrum trading or potentially new spectrum sharing models. At the service level, enhanced mobile broadband services would be provided by MNOs and MVNOs, alongside new services enabled by existing and new players. 3.4.1 How we assessed these models 188. We have considered the potential models against a range of criteria \u2013 including the extent of 5G coverage, the pace of roll out, the costs, the incentives to improve quality and innovation over time, and how feasible it would be to implement the models.87 189. The Government recognises there is a debate about the optimal level of competitive intensity and consolidation in the UK mobile sector, and notes the number of recent mobile merger control cases across Europe, with a range of outcomes. The Government is clear that network competition between MNOs has been an important driver of mobile investment and expects that this will continue to be the case for 5G. Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review 59 190. As far as the Government is concerned, there is no magic number of mobile network operators. Each merger control case should be assessed on its merits at a particular time, by the relevant authorities. The European Commission, supported by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority, rejected a proposed merger of O2 and Three in 2016 because of pricing concerns resulting from a reduction in retail competition; concerns about the impact that a merger of MNOs in different network sharing arrangements would have on innovation and network roll out; and unease that there would be a reduction in wholesale competition with fewer potential hosts for MVNOs.88 191. There can be a tension between incentivising investment (with positive consumer benefits in the longer-term) and protecting consumers from the risk of higher retail prices in the short-term. Some argue that the increased cost efficiencies and increased scale from consolidation would enable greater investment and better consumer outcomes.89 At the same time, other analysis suggests there is no significant difference in industry-level investment between four and three player markets.90 Mobile investment should be closely monitored by Ofcom and appropriate options considered if it were to become clear that the current market structure was not supporting network investment in 5G at sustainable levels.",

They were then more likely to have not considered an upgrade to their connection in the past because it was not available to them, with 81% citing this reason while the rate was 71% in commercial areas. In the non-commercial areas, respondents also reported a higher level of satisfaction with their pre-connection broadband, Generally, people\u2019s awareness of the connection being connected to the Hub investments into nearby public buildings was low (at 9%). However, this knowledge was more common in the remote, non-commercial properties at 12%, being 6% in the commercial areas The marketing of vouchers to residential broadband users is primarily through suppliers, who would then provide the connection and draw the voucher funding. When asked about how beneficiaries heard about the voucher scheme, generally the response that this was from the supplier was high. However, in remote areas in terms of the modelled cost of connecting residences, the households close to a Hub reported hearing about the voucher support through the community over half the time. They were also relatively unaware of the possibility of having a fast connection, assuming they were too remote. The survey also reveals a marginally higher knowledge of the Hub investment in this subsample. Conclusions This chapter presents the results of a survey of residential and business voucher beneficiaries where the connection was near (within a 5km radius) to a Hub. The analysis uses a set of questions that were asked recently in a large survey conducted to evaluate vouchers more generally, and results from that survey provides the potential effect of the Hubs in terms of a comparator. \u25cf Residential survey had 1,518 respondents with 33 follow-up interviews. Residents that live close to a Hub are similar in profile to residents in the comparison sample in terms of age, employment status, household size and income. There were some statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding household type, housing tenure, and occupation. The comparator survey had 1,356 respondents. \u25cf Use of internet similar to non-Hub voucher beneficiaries. The comparison group and the Hubs sample are making greater use of the internet for personal, education and professional purposes. Some small statistically significant differences were found in the data \u2013 a slightly lower proportion of residents in the Hubs sample are making greater use of streaming entertainment services and keeping in touch with family and friends. \u25cf There are community-level networks. Residents close to a Hub were more likely to have heard about the voucher through a local community initiative, and it was less likely to be through a broadband supplier, compared to residents in the voucher sample.

        "response": "Passive infrastructure sharing, such as the use of existing ducts and poles, plays a crucial role in the UK's plan for nationwide full fibre deployment. This approach is integral to achieving the country's ambitious broadband goals and aligns with regulatory objectives in several ways:\n\n1. **Cost Reduction**:\n   - Sharing existing infrastructure significantly reduces the cost of deploying new fibre networks. By utilizing existing ducts and poles, network providers can avoid the high expenses associated with civil engineering works, which are often the most costly part of network deployment.\n\n2. **Accelerated Deployment**:\n   - By leveraging existing infrastructure, network providers can accelerate the rollout of full fibre networks. This is particularly important in meeting the UK government's targets for widespread gigabit-capable broadband coverage.\n\n3. **Increased Competition**:\n   - Infrastructure sharing encourages competition by lowering barriers to entry for new market players. Smaller providers can enter the market without the need to build their own extensive infrastructure, fostering a more competitive environment.\n\n4. **Regulatory Support**:\n   - The UK's regulatory body, Ofcom, supports passive infrastructure sharing as a means to promote competition and accelerate broadband deployment. Ofcom has implemented measures to ensure that incumbent operators, like Openreach, provide access to their ducts and poles to other providers on fair and reasonable terms.\n\n5. **Efficient Use of Resources**:\n   - Sharing infrastructure leads to more efficient use of existing resources, minimizing environmental impact and reducing the need for new construction in urban and rural areas.\n\n6. **Alignment with Policy Goals**:\n   - The UK government's digital strategy emphasizes the importance of full fibre and gigabit-capable networks as foundational to economic growth and digital inclusion. Infrastructure sharing is a key component in achieving these policy goals by facilitating faster and more cost-effective network expansion.\n\nOverall, passive infrastructure sharing is a strategic approach that aligns with regulatory goals to enhance competition, reduce deployment costs, and expedite the rollout of high-speed broadband across the UK. It is a critical element in the broader strategy to ensure that the UK remains competitive in the digital economy and that all regions have access to reliable and fast internet services.",

We have measured a consequential significant change in overall Fibre-To-The-Premise coverage in the first year since completion (2018/19). \u25cf The Trans Pennine Initiative (TPI) funded the placement of gigabit-capable fibre infrastructure along the existing rail route between Manchester and York, in partnership with Network Rail Telecoms. They have used this project to develop a commercial blueprint for use across the UK rail network, enabling suppliers to access trackside fibre to deliver connectivity in some of the remotest locations in the UK. Data within the report highlights that there has been an increase in network providers offering Fibre-To-The-Premise (FTTP) services along the TPI route. 13 This project was an early pathfinder for the GigaHub model, which brings together local public sector customers to create enough broadband demand to reduce the financial risk of building new full fibre networks. The solution is often a public sector network of sites that provide spine and backhaul fibre to a location.

We are in the process of implementing a rolling Open Market Review process, establishing a maintained national view of commercial build plans for the following three years. This will give a more comprehensive up-to-date view of commercial delivery and will avoid the need for having dedicated local Open Market Reviews. This is followed by a Public Review to validate the findings of the Open Market Review and BDUK\u2019s mapping to ensure it correctly represents the information provided by suppliers and to ensure that the right areas are targeted by Project Gigabit subsidy. BDUK invites stakeholders (including the public, businesses, internet service providers and broadband infrastructure operators) to provide us with feedback about the proposed eligible areas for government investment set out in each Public Review document.

In approving a project, the Commission explicitly recognise that the scheme is State aid, but that the benefits from the Programme outweigh the level of market distortion generated by the scheme, following the application of the so-called \u2018balancing test\u2019. In a decision, the Commission give a set of requirements that must be followed precisely in order to comply with State aid norms. 2.2.1 2012 scheme The key aspects of the procurement models under the 2012 scheme were: \u25aa All procurement models were based on an Open Tender Process. The tender process must ensure transparency, non-discriminatory treatment, and objective evaluation criteria, and contracts must be awarded to the most economically advantageous offer. \u25aa A National Procurement Framework (known as Broadband Delivery Framework) was prepared by BDUK with the intention to provide Local Bodies with a panel of potential suppliers. To do this, BDUK 5 Available at: https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0025/69262/infrastructure-report.pdf Ipsos MORI | 18-101398-01 Evaluation of the Superfast Broadband Programme \u2013 Process evaluation report 16 18-101398-01 | FINAL VERSION | | Internal Use Only | This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for Market Research, ISO 20252, and with the Ipsos MORI Terms and Conditions which can be found at http://www.ipsos-mori.com/terms. \u00a9 Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport 2021 held an industry day to provide potential suppliers with information about the framework and allow suppliers to provide feedback, and then published an Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) notice. \u2212 Nine companies had pre-qualified to submit tenders, and three were chosen to submit final tenders. \u2212 Two suppliers (BT and Fujitsu) were appointed to the National Procurement Framework. However, Fujistu did not take part in the Superfast Broadband Programme after this point, and did not deliver any local projects. \u25aa Local Bodies ran mini-competitions to select one single supplier (BT / OpenReach) from the framework",

Superfast availability rose from 22 percent of premises in 2016 to just over 60 percent on postcodes that benefitted from subsidised upgrades by September 2019. Superfast availability rose in postcodes in the matched comparison group at a slower rate (from 25 percent to just over 45 percent). Most of this apparent impact on broadband availability occurred in the 2019 which aligns with the delivery profile of Phase 3 contracts (see figure below). Figure 4.2: Evolution of superfast availability, postcodes receiving subsidised coverage by September 2019 and matched group of eligible postcodes, Phase 3 Source: Connected Nations, Ofcom, Ipsos MORI analysis The statistical analyses provided estimates of the increase in share of premises benefitting from NGA, superfast and FTTP availability between 2016 and 2019 that could be attributed to the delivery of Phase 3 contracts. These estimates were applied to the number of premises on the postcodes benefitting from the Programme to reach an estimate of the number of additional premises receiving subsidised coverage by September 2019. These results are summarised in the table below: On postcodes benefitting from subsidised coverage by September 2019, Phase 3 contracts were estimated to have increased the number of premises: \u25aa Passed by NGA coverage by 2,300 to 16,600 (with the weight of results towards the lower end of this range). \u25aa With superfast coverage (30Mbps) by 10,800 to 29,300. \u25aa With FTTP coverage by 19,000 to 30,300. 21 Available at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/superfast-broadband-programme-state-aid-evaluation-report-2020 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Avergae % of premises with superfast (30Mbit/s) coverage Postcodes benefitting from subsidised coverage by September 2019 Comparison postcodes eligible for investment sharing equivalent characteristics Ipsos MORI | 18-101398-01 Evaluation of the Superfast Broadband Programme \u2013 Process evaluation report 51 18-101398-01 | FINAL VERSION | | Internal Use Only | This work was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the international quality standard for Market Research, ISO 20252, and with the Ipsos MORI Terms and Conditions which can be found at http://www.ipsos-mori.com/terms. \u00a9",

These broad questions were further refined as part of an initial planning stage that was completed in May 2019, which involved the agreement of bespoke evaluation questions for each of the projects and evaluation approach. This report builds on a baseline, process and early impacts assessment that was completed in July 2019 and the interim evaluations which took place in 2020-2022. This",
