Project Gigabit, however, aims for nationwide coverage, indicating a broader ambition.  The increased funding (\u00a35 billion for Project Gigabit compared to the unspecified amounts for the Superfast Broadband Programme) allows for a potentially more extensive infrastructure rollout.  Furthermore, Project Gigabit emphasizes a package of coordinated interventions, suggesting a more integrated approach to overcome deployment challenges.\n\nWhile the text doesn't explicitly state lessons learned, the increased funding, national scope, and focus on coordinated interventions imply that Project Gigabit is designed to address limitations of the previous program.  The specific mention of additional funding to extend contracts from the Superfast Broadband Programme suggests a recognition of the value of existing projects and a desire to leverage previous efforts.  The emphasis on addressing market failures to avoid distorting competition also indicates a more sophisticated understanding of the complexities of broadband infrastructure deployment.",

By the time the review was published, the local market conditions might have changed, making the data submitted less accurate.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Participation:**  There were mixed responses from suppliers and local authorities regarding their involvement in the OMR process. Some participated frequently, while others did not, making data collection inconsistent and potentially incomplete.\n\n3. **Unclear Assessment Criteria:** Suppliers expressed concerns about the clarity of assessment criteria for OMR responses and how those responses were weighted. This lack of clarity could lead to subjective interpretations and potentially biased evaluations.\n\n4. **Technical Mismatches:**  Suppliers offering gigabit-capable networks but not employing fiber-optic ground infrastructure were rejected on technical grounds, despite claiming gigabit capability.
